abstract = {Long-term treatment with the dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) induces dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We divided hemiparkinsonian rats treated chronically with L-DOPA into two groups: one showed motor improvement without dyskinesia, and the other developed debilitating dyskinesias in response to the treatment. We then compared the plasticity of corticostriatal synapses between the two groups. High-frequency stimulation of cortical afferents induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of corticostriatal synapses in both groups of animals. Control and non-dyskinetic rats showed synaptic depotentiation in response to subsequent low-frequency synaptic stimulation, but dyskinetic rats did not. The depotentiation seen in both L-DOPA-treated non-dyskinetic rats and intact controls was prevented by activation of the D1 subclass of dopamine receptors or inhibition of protein phosphatases. The striata of dyskinetic rats contained abnormally high levels of phospho[Thr34]-DARPP-32, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1. These results indicate that abnormal information storage in corticostriatal synapses is linked with the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.},

abstract = {Early prediction of outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often difficult. To improve prognostic accuracy soon after trauma, we compared different radiological modalities and anatomical injury distribution in a group of adult TBI patients. The four methods studied were computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). The objective of this study was to identify which modality and anatomic model best predict outcome. The patient population consisted of 38 adults admitted between February 2001 and May 2003. Early CT, T2WI, FLAIR, and SWI were obtained for each patient as well as a Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) between 0.1 and 22 months (mean 9.2 months) after injury. Using a semi-automated computer method, intraparenchymal lesions were traced, measured, and converted to lesion volumes based on slice thickness and pixel size. Lesions were assigned to zones and regions. Outcomes were dichotomized into good (GOS 4-5) and poor (GOS 1-3) outcome groups. Brain injury detected by imaging was analyzed by median total lesion volume, median volume per lesion, and median number of lesions per outcome group. T2WI and FLAIR imaging most consistently discriminated between good and poor outcomes by median total lesion volume, median volume per lesion, and median number of lesions. In addition, T2WI and FLAIR imaging most consistently discriminated between good and poor outcomes by zonal distribution. While SWI rarely discriminated by outcome, it was very sensitive to intraparenchymal injury and its optimal use in evaluating TBI is unclear. SWI and other new imaging modalities should be further studied to fully evaluate their prognostic utility in TBI evaluation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lumbar discectomy is the most common type of back surgery performed in the United States. Outcomes after this procedure can be variable and it appears that Workers' Compensation patients might be at increased risk for poor outcomes. PURPOSE: To examine long-term multidimensional outcomes of lumbar discectomy within a cohort of Workers' Compensation patients from Utah and identify presurgical biopsychosocial factors related to poor outcomes. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective cohort study consisting of a review of presurgical medical records and assessment of patient outcomes via a telephone survey. Outcomes were assessed at least 2 years postsurgery. PATIENT SAMPLE: A consecutive sample of 271 workers from Utah who underwent lumbar discectomy from 1994 to 1999. A total of 134 patients were surveyed at the time of follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient satisfaction, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, SF-36v2, and Stauffer-Coventry Index. METHODS: A retrospective review of presurgical biopsychosocial variables and outcome assessment via telephone survey was conducted. RESULTS: Work disability rate for the cohort was 12.7{\%} (17/134). Analysis of patient satisfaction, back pain-related dysfunction, and the Short-Form Health Survey-36 subscales indicated approximately 25{\%} of patients experienced poor outcomes. Older age, number of comorbid health conditions, assigned case manager, litigation, and time delay from injury to surgery were consistently statistically significant predictors (p{\textless}.05) of poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that compensated back surgery patients are at greater risk for poor lumbar discectomy outcomes than noncompensation patients. Presurgery correlates of poor outcomes may be useful in identifying high-risk compensation patients},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging measures have been proposed as objective markers to study upper motor neuron loss in motor neuron disorders. Cross-sectional studies have identified imaging differences between groups of healthy controls and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) that correlate with disease severity, but it is not known whether imaging measures change as disease progresses. Additionally, whether imaging measures change in a similar fashion with disease progression in PLS and ALS is unclear. To address these questions, clinical and imaging evaluations were first carried out in a prospective cross-sectional study of 23 ALS and 22 PLS patients with similar motor impairment and 19 age-matched healthy controls. Clinical evaluations consisted of a neurological examination, the ALS Functional rating scale-revised, and measures of finger tapping, gait, and timed speech. Age and ALSFRS score were not different, but PLS patients had longer duration of symptoms. Imaging measures examined were cortical thickness, regional brain volumes, and diffusion tensor imaging of the corticospinal tract and callosum. Imaging measures that differed from controls in a cross-sectional vertex-wise analysis were used as regions of interest for longitudinal analysis, which was carried out in 9 of the ALS patients (interval 1.26 ± 0.72 years) and 12 PLS patients (interval 2.08 ± 0.93 years). In the cross-sectional study both groups had areas of cortical thinning, which was more extensive in motor regions in PLS patients. At follow-up, clinical measures declined more in ALS than PLS patients. Cortical thinning and grey matter volume loss of the precentral gyri progressed over the follow-up interval. Fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tracts remained stable, but the cross-sectional area declined in ALS patients. Changes in clinical measures correlated with changes in precentral cortical thickness and grey matter volume. The rate of cortical thinning was greater in ALS patients with shorter disease durations, suggesting that thickness decreases in a non-linear fashion. Thus, cortical thickness changes are a potential imaging marker for disease progression in individual patients, but the magnitude of change likely depends on disease duration and progression rate. Differences between PLS and ALS patients in the magnitude of thinning in cross-sectional studies are likely to reflect longer disease duration. We conclude that there is an evolution of structural imaging changes with disease progression in motor neuron disorders. Some changes, such as diffusion properties of the corticospinal tract, occur early while cortical thinning and volume loss occur later. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {AIM: To discuss the variations and distributions of authors who published their papers in World Journal of Gastroenterology (WJG) during 2001-2007 and evaluate the development of WJG and gastroenterology core journals in recent years by comparing the contributions of the authors.

METHODS: WJG articles published in 2001-2007 were searched from MEDLINE database (by ISI Web of Knowledge). The variations (cooperation degree, cooperation rate) and distributions of the first authors were analyzed with bibliometric methods. SCIE was used to collect articles published in Am J Gastroenterol, Gastroenterology, Scand J Gastroenterol and WJG in 2007, and comparison of the data was made. Comparison indicators included the article number of annual journals, cooperation degree of authors, cooperation rate, mean number of articles published in each WJG issue, number of countries of the first WJG authors, geographical distribution and article contribution ratio of all WJG authors and domestic authors.

RESULTS: Of the 5851 articles covered in MEDLINE, 173, 236, 633, 826, 1496, 1382 and 1105 articles were cited from 2001 to 2007. The cooperation degree was 5.11, 5.56, 5.75, 5.76, 6.31, 5.90 and 5.64 respectively. The cooperation rates was 94.80{\%}, 99.15{\%}, 98.89{\%}, 98.55{\%}, 99.13{\%}, 96.67{\%} and 95.66{\%}, respectively. The mean number of articles published in each WJG issue from 2001 to 2007 was 28, 39, 52, 34, 31, 28 and 23, respectively. The number of countries of the first WJG authors was 8, 8, 27, 32, 49, 61 and 56, respectively. The first authors of WJG came from 3 continents in 2001 and covered 6 continents in 2006-2007. The number of articles written by Asian authors was 136 (79.07{\%}), 227 (96.19{\%}), 575 (90.98{\%}), 713 (87.81{\%}), 1111 (75.32{\%}), 712 (53.98{\%}) and 555 (53.21{\%}), respectively in 2001-2007. The number of articles written by European {\&} American authors increased from 36 (20.93{\%}) and 8 (3.39{\%}) in 2001-2002 to 563 (42.68{\%}) and 452(43.34{\%}) in 2006-2007. The number of countries except for China contributing papers was increased. The number of articles written by first authors of Japan rose from 0 (0{\%}) in 2001-2002 to 287 (12.15{\%}) in 2006-2007. The number of articles written by American authors increased from 6 (1.47{\%}) in 2001-2002 to 158 (6.69{\%}) in 2006-2007. The number of articles written by Chinese authors was 136 (79.07{\%}), 227 (96.19{\%}), 548 (86.71{\%}), 669 (82.39{\%}), 884 (59.93{\%}), 380 (28.81{\%}) and 320 (30.68{\%}), respectively, in 2001 to 2007. The number of articles published in Am J Gastroenterol, Gastroenterology, Scand J Gastroenterol and WJG was 565, 586, 238 and 1118, respectively in 2007. The cooperation degree was 4.77, 6.14, 5.95 and 5.64, respectively, in 2007. The cooperation rate was 95.40{\%}, 84.18{\%}, 96.63{\%} and 95.66{\%}, respectively, in 2007. The number of countries of authors contributing papers was 44, 35, 42 and 62, respectively, in 2007.

CONCLUSION: The geographical distribution of WJG authors is wide for the past 2 years. WJG has made a step onto international publishing, and drawn even more attentions from gastroenterology researchers. Its authors are distributed over 74 countries in 6 global continents, and the journal has become the main intermediary for international gastroenterology researchers to demonstrate their research accomplishments.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely applied to investigate injuries in the central nervous system (CNS) white matter (WM). However, the underlying pathological correlates of diffusion changes have not been adequately determined. In this study the coregistration of histological sections to MR images and a pixel-based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to compare the axial (lambda( parallel)) and radial (lambda( perpendicular)) diffusivities derived from DTI and histological markers of axon (phosphorylated neurofilament, SMI-31) and myelin (Luxol fast blue (LFB)) integrity, respectively, in two different patterns of injury to mouse spinal cord (SC) WM. In contusion SC injury (SCI), a decrease in lambda( parallel) matched the pattern of axonal damage with high accuracy, but lambda( perpendicular) did not match the pattern of demyelination detected by LFB. In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), lambda( perpendicular) and lambda( parallel) did not match the patterns of demyelination or axonal damage, respectively. However, a region of interest (ROI) analysis suggested that lambda( perpendicular)-detected demyelination paralleled that observed with LFB, and lambda( parallel) decreased in both regions of axonal damage and normal-appearing WM (NAWM) as visualized by SMI-31. The results suggest that directional diffusivities may reveal abnormalities that are not obvious with SMI-31 and LFB staining, depending on the type of injury},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI provides quantitative information about microstructural properties which can be useful in neuroimaging studies of the human brain. Echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences, which are frequently used for acquisition of diffusion images, are sensitive to inhomogeneities in the primary magnetic (B0) field that cause localized distortions in the reconstructed images. We describe and evaluate a new method for correction of susceptibility-induced distortion in diffusion images in the absence of an accurate B0 fieldmap. In our method, the distortion field is estimated using a constrained non-rigid registration between an undistorted T1-weighted anatomical image and one of the distorted EPI images from diffusion acquisition. Our registration framework is based on a new approach, INVERSION (Inverse contrast Normalization for VERy Simple registratION), which exploits the inverted contrast relationship between T1- and T2-weighted brain images to define a simple and robust similarity measure. We also describe how INVERSION can be used for rigid alignment of diffusion images and T1-weighted anatomical images. Our approach is evaluated with multiple in vivo datasets acquired with different acquisition parameters. Compared to other methods, INVERSION shows robust and consistent performance in rigid registration and shows improved alignment of diffusion and anatomical images relative to normalized mutual information for non-rigid distortion correction.},

abstract = {Background Chronic pain is characterised by maladaptive neuroplasticity in many systems, including the motor system. There is evidence that patients with chronic pain demonstrate altered corticospinal and intracortical excitability; however, findings are inconsistent and existing literature in this area has not been systematically reviewed. Objective To systematically review studies examining corticospinal and intracortical excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation in people with chronic pain compared to healthy controls and to provide a meta-analysis of study outcomes. Methods Databases were searched for controlled studies evaluating corticospinal and intracortical excitability in chronic pain conditions. Outcome measure data were entered into separate meta-analyses and effect sizes calculated. A subgroup analysis based on the type of chronic pain population was also performed. Results Forty-three studies were included, encompassing a pooled total of 1009 people with chronic pain and 658 control participants. Significant effect sizes (P {\textless} 0.05) indicated that in chronic pain populations the duration of the silent period and the extent of short-interval intracortical inhibition were both reduced and short-interval intracortical facilitation was enhanced. The subgroup analysis revealed that only the neuropathic pain group exhibited significant effect sizes for these outcome measures. Effect sizes for the remaining outcome measures were not significant Conclusions There is evidence of motor cortex disinhibition in chronic pain populations, suggestive of a disruption in GABA-mediated intracortical inhibition. Disinhibition was more pronounced in populations with neuropathic pain. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between chronic pain and motor cortex excitability, which may have meaningful implications for the future treatment of chronic pain conditions.},

Neurophysiological recordings from two classes of ascending spinothalamic tract neurons that are sensitive to innocuous or noxious cold showed differential responses to the grill. On the basis of these results, a simple model of central disinhibition, or unmasking, predicted a quantitative correspondence between grill-evoked pain and cold-evoked pain, which was verified psychophysically. This integration of pain and temperature can explain the thermal grill illusion and the burning sensation of cold pain and may also provide a basis for the cold-evoked, burning pain of the classic thalamic pain syndrome.},

@article{Markenson1996,
abstract = {Chronic pain differs from acute pain in that it serves no useful function, causes suffering, limits activities of daily living, and increases costs of healthcare payments, disability, and litigation fees. Pain perception begins with activation of peripheral nociceptors and conduction through myelinated A delta and unmyelinated C fibers to the dorsal root ganglion. From here, signals travel via the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus and the somatosensory cortex. Modulation of sensory input (i.e., pain) occurs at many levels. Nociceptors are also neuroeffectors, and transmission can be modulated by their cell bodies, which secrete inflammatory mediators, neuropeptides, or other pain-producing substances. Descending pathways from the hypothalamus, which has opioid-sensitive receptors and is stimulated by arousal and emotional stress, can transmit signals to the dorsal horn that modulate ascending nociceptive transmissions. Modulation to alter the perception of pain also can occur at higher centers (e.g., frontal cortex, midbrain, medulla) by opioids, anti-inflammatory agents, as well as antagonists and agonists of neurotransmitters. This article will review our current knowledge of the mechanisms involved in (1) the transduction of tissue injury or disease signals (nociception and nociceptive receptors); (2) the transmission of signals rostrally to the thalamus and higher nervous system centers (involving perception of the quality, location, and intensity of noxious signals); and (3) the modulation of ascending sensory messages at all levels (periphery, spinal cord, and higher centers)},

abstract = {Several issues regarding diagnosis, pharmacological treatment, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are still unsettled. The American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies launched a joint Task Force to prepare general guidelines for the management of this condition. After systematic review of the literature the Task Force came to a series of evidence-based recommendations. In patients with TN MRI may be considered to identify patients with structural causes. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes should be considered useful to disclose symptomatic TN, whereas younger age of onset, involvement of the first division, unresponsiveness to treatment and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials are not useful in distinguishing symptomatic from classic TN. Carbamazepine (stronger evidence) or oxcarbazepine (better tolerability) should be offered as first-line treatment for pain control. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy early surgical therapy may be considered. Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife and microvascular decompression may be considered. Microvascular decompression may be considered over other surgical techniques to provide the longest duration of pain freedom. The role of surgery versus pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with multiple sclerosis remains uncertain},

abstract = {The development of the neuroimaging technique has revolutionized clinical neurology. This is also true in the field of stroke. Because of the easy accessibility and little time consuming, the computed tomography (CT) should be applied first to the stroke patient and other examinations should be prepared later to the patient due to the severity and the characteristic of the lesion. These are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including MR angiography. MR spectroscopy, diffusion MRI), cerebral angiography, neurosonography (carotid ultrasound, color flow imaging, transcranial Doppler), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), etc. It is a matter of common sense that CT and MRI are now particularly important among laboratory examinations for neurological diseases and these non-invasive techniques will become more important for the elderly stroke patients. Recent study cleared the combination of 3-dimensional computed angiography and neurosonography has an informative value and this is especially important for the elderly patients who are fragile and need rapid and accurate diagnosis.},

MRI criteria were first included in the diagnostic work-up for multiple sclerosis in 2001, and since then several modifications to the criteria have been proposed in an attempt to simplify lesion-count models for showing disease dissemination in space, change the timing of MRI scanning to show dissemination in time, and increase the value of spinal cord imaging. Since the last update of these criteria, new data on the use of MRI to establish dissemination in space and time have become available, and MRI technology has improved.

In this study, we used ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI to directly visualize the architectonic features that define EC rostrocaudally and mediolaterally, then applied surface-based registration techniques to quantify the variability of EC with respect to cortical geometry, and made predictions of its location on in vivo scans. The results indicate that EC can be localized quite accurately based on cortical folding patterns, within 3 mm in vivo, a significant step forward in our ability to detect the earliest effects of AD when clinical intervention is most likely to be effective.},

The frontotemporal dementias selectively target these large-scale systems, leading to at least three distinct clinical syndromes. Examining these disorders, researchers have begun to dissect functions which rely on specific insular nodes and networks. In the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, early-stage frontoinsular degeneration begets progressive "Salience Network" breakdown that leaves patients unable to model the emotional impact of their own actions or inactions. Ongoing studies seek to clarify local microcircuit- and cellular-level factors that confer selective frontoinsular vulnerability. The search for frontotemporal dementia treatments will depend on a rich understanding of insular biology and could help clarify specialized human language, social, and emotional functions.},

abstract = {In vivo white matter tractography by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become a popular tool for investigation of white matter architecture in the normal brain. Despite some unresolved issues regarding the accuracy of DTI, recent studies applied DTI for delineating white matter organization in the vicinity of brain lesions and especially brain tumors. Apart from the intrinsic limitations of DTI, the tracking of fibers in the vicinity or within lesions is further complicated due to changes in diseased tissue such as elevated water content (edema), tissue compression and degeneration. These changes deform the architecture of the white matter and in some cases prevent definite selection of the seed region of interest (ROI) from which fiber tracking begins. We show here that for displaced fiber systems, the use of anatomical approach for seed ROI selection yields insufficient results. Alternatively, we propose to select the seed points based on functional MRI activations which constrain the subjective seed ROI selection. The results are demonstrated on two major fiber systems: the pyramidal tract and the superior longitudinal fasciculus that connect critical motor and language areas, respectively. The fMRI based seed ROI selection approach enabled a more comprehensive mapping of these fiber systems. Furthermore, this procedure enabled the characterization of displaced white matter using the eigenvalue decomposition of DTI. We show that along the compressed fiber system, the diffusivity parallel to the fiber increases, while that perpendicular to the fibers decreases, leading to an overall increase in the fractional anisotropy index reflecting the compression of the fiber bundle. We conclude that definition of the functional network of a subject with deformed white matter should be done carefully. With fMRI, one can more accurately define the seed ROI for DTI based tractography and to provide a more comprehensive, functionally related, white matter mapping, a very important tool used in pre-surgical mapping},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has heterogeneous clinical features that could be translated into specific patterns of brain atrophy. In the current study we have evaluated the relationship between different clinical expressions of classical ALS and measurements of brain cortical thickness. Cortical thickness analysis was conducted from 3D-MRI using FreeSurfer software in 29 ALS patients and 20 healthy controls. We explored three clinical traits of the disease, subdividing the patients into two groups for each of them: the bulbar or spinal onset, the higher or lower upper motor neuron burden, the faster or slower disease progression. We used both a whole brain vertex-wise analysis and a ROI analysis on primary motor areas. ALS patients showed cortical thinning in bilateral precentral gyrus, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus and right occipital cortex. ALS patients with higher upper motor neuron burden showed a significant cortical thinning in the right precentral gyrus and in other frontal extra-motor areas, compared to healthy controls. ALS patients with spinal onset showed a significant cortical thinning in the right precentral gyrus and paracentral lobule, compared to healthy controls. ALS patients with faster progressive disease showed a significant cortical thinning in widespread bilateral frontal and temporal areas, including the bilateral precentral gyrus, compared to healthy controls. Focusing on the primary motor areas, the ROI analysis revealed that the mean cortical thickness values were significantly reduced in ALS patients with higher upper motor neuron burden, spinal onset and faster disease progression related to healthy controls. In conclusion, the thickness of primary motor cortex could be a useful surrogate marker of upper motor neuron involvement in ALS; also our results suggest that cortical thinning in motor and non motor areas seem to reflect the clinical heterogeneity of the disease.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine a suitable registration algorithm for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using conventional preprocessing tools [statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and automated image registration (AIR)] and to investigate how anisotropic indices for clinical assessments are affected by these distortion corrections. Materials and Methods: Brain DTI data from 15 normal healthy volunteers were used to evaluate four spatial registration schemes within subjects to correct image distortions: noncorrection, SPM-based affine registration, AIR-based affine registration and AIR-based nonlinear polynomial warping. The performance of each distortion correction was assessed using: (a) quantitative parameters: tensor-fitting error (Ef), mean dispersion index (MDI), mean fractional anisotropy (MFA) and mean variance (MV) within 11 regions of interest (ROI) defined from homogeneous fiber bundles; and (b) fiber tractography through the uncinate fasciculus and the corpus callosum. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated to demonstrate the effects of distortion correction. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to investigate differences among the four registration paradigms. Results: AIR-based nonlinear registration showed the best performance for reducing image distortions with respect to smaller Ef (P{\textless}.02), MDI (P{\textless}.01) and MV (P{\textless}.01) with larger MFA (P{\textless}.01). FA was decreased to correct distortions (P{\textless}.0001) whether the applied registration was linear or nonlinear and was lowest after nonlinear correction (P{\textless}.001). No significant differences were found in MD. Conclusion: In conventional DTI processing, anisotropic indices of FA can be misestimated by noncorrection or inappropriate distortion correction, which leads to an erroneous increase in FA. AIR-based nonlinear distortion correction would be required for a more accurate measurement of this diffusion parameter. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Invasive procedures for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) include percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation (PRT), partial sensory rhizotomy (PSR), and microvascular decompression (MVD). Using a nationwide discharge registry from The Netherlands, we assessed the frequency of use and patient characteristics, and evaluated treatment failure for each patient undergoing PRT, PSR, or MVD from January 2002 through December 2004. Only patients without a procedure in the year prior were included. Primary outcome was readmission for repeat procedures for TGN or known complications within 1year. Comparability of patient populations was assessed through propensity scores based on hospital, age, sex, and comorbidity. Conditional logistic regression matched on propensity score was used to calculate relative risks (RR) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for repeat procedures or complications. During the study period, 672 patients with TGN underwent PRT, 39 underwent PSR, and 87 underwent MVD. Hospital type was the predominant determinant of procedure type; age, sex, and comorbidity were weak predictors. The RR for repeat procedures for PSR was 0.21 (95{\%} CI: 0.07 to 0.65) and for MVD was 0.13 (95{\%} CI: 0.05 to 0.35) compared with PRT (RR 1). For complications, the RR of PSR was 5.36 (95{\%} CI: 1.46 to 19.64) and of MVD was 4.40 (95{\%} CI: 1.44 to 13.42). Sex, urbanization, and comorbidity did not influence prognosis, but hospital and surgical volume did. In conclusion, although PSR and MVD are associated with a lower risk of repeat procedure than PRT, they seem to be more prone to complications requiring hospital readmission. Microvascular decompression and partial sensory rhizotomy are associated with a lower risk of undergoing a repeat procedure compared with percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation but are more prone to complications requiring readmission to hospital},

abstract = {For over twenty years neuroimaging has made a substantial impact on our understanding of human pain experiences within the experimental, acute and chronic setting. Functional activity that relates to the perceptual experience or its modulation, alongside structural, neurochemical and receptor changes, have given us remarkable insight to the extraordinary events that underpin human pain and its transition to or vulnerability towards chronic pain. These insights at a systems neuroscience level have largely focussed on the human brain and to a lesser extent the spinal cord; however, more recently preclinical neuroimaging using similar metrics is gathering pace. Taken together, we are at a stage where mechanisms identified in preclinical models can be verified and extended via a neuroimaging metric in either experimental medicine models or patients, where novel pain mechanisms can be discovered using human neuroimaging to inform new ways to stratify or treat patients as well as inform preclinical models, and finally where mechanisms that underpin core symptoms can be better understood using newly developed neuroimaging methods that again can be forward and reverse translated for patient benefit. While these developments are welcome, some extrapolations of their use bring challenges as the lure of neuroimaging pain penetrates society beyond the lab and clinic. Here, I will review just some of these exciting developments.},

This is demonstrated by involuntary movements induced by STN lesions and the successful treatment of Parkinson's disease by STN stimulation. However, it is still unclear how individual STN neurons participate in motor control. Here, we report that the STN has a function in switching from automatic to volitionally controlled eye movement. In the STN of trained macaque monkeys, we found neurons that showed a phasic change in activity specifically before volitionally controlled saccades which were switched from automatic saccades. A majority of switch-related neurons were considered to inhibit no-longer-valid automatic processes, and the inhibition started early enough to enable the animal to switch. We suggest that the STN mediates the control signal originated from the medial frontal cortex and implements the behavioral switching function using its connections with other basal ganglia nuclei and the superior colliculus.},

Damage to these fibres has notable behavioural and cognitive sequelae that depend on the exact location of the fibre loss. Until now, correlations between fibre loss and neurological disorders have been limited to post-mortem studies. Here we used probabilistic diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography to produce a two-dimensional map of the CC in the mid-sagittal plane. We observed an antero-posterior topography of interhemispheric tracts within the CC, consistent with our current neuroanatomical understanding of post-mortem studies in human. Callosal tract to the left and right hemispheres had comparable volume. Gender, a factor that is often reported to affect CC shape and geometry, also had no effect on the volume of the tracts. Our map showed high consistency across individuals. We propose that this map might be useful in the study of the effects of damage to human CC in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Voxel size/shape of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may directly affect the measurement of fractional anisotropy (FA) in regions where there are crossing fibers. The purpose of this article was to investigate the effect of voxel size/shape on measured FA by using isotropic and nonisotropic voxels. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten healthy adult volunteers had MR imaging by using a 1.5 T clinical imager. DTI was performed with 2 different voxel sizes: a 2-mm-section isotropic voxel (2 x 2 x 2 mm(3)) and a 6-mm-section nonisotropic voxel (2 x 2 x 6 mm(3)). Images were obtained by using a single-shot echo-planar imaging technique with motion-probing gradients in 15 orientations and a b-value of 1000 s/mm(2). FA and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured at different sites of the brain. RESULTS When smaller isotropic voxels were used, the FA was greater in areas with crossing fibers, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the thalamus, and the red nucleus; the FA was not significantly different in areas without crossing fibers, such as the corpus callosum, the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the corticospinal tract at the level of the centrum semiovale (P{\textgreater}.05). The ADC values were not affected by voxel size/shape at any of the areas of the brain that were measured.

abstract = {The mechanism of selective loss of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has not been clarified. Mitochondrial pathology is present in central nervous system tissue from ALS cases and occurs as an early event in a mouse model of ALS. We demonstrate that, in sporadic ALS, there is a selective decrease in the activity of the mitochondrial DNA-encoded enzyme cytochrome c oxidase in human spinal cord motor neurons. We propose that this may not only be important in neuronal cell death but could well be caused by oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA leading to the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted imaging can potentially be used to infer the connectivity of the human brain in vivo using fibre-tracking techniques, and is therefore of great interest to neuroscientists and clinicians. A key requirement for fibre tracking is the accurate estimation of white matter fibre orientations within each imaging voxel. The diffusion tensor model, which is widely used for this purpose, has been shown to be inadequate in crossing fibre regions. A number of approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue, based on high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) data. In this study, an experimental model of crossing fibres, consisting of water-filled plastic capillaries, is used to thoroughly assess three such techniques: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), super-resolved CSD (super-CSD) and Q-ball imaging (QBI). HARDI data were acquired over a range of crossing angles and b-values, from which fibre orientations were computed using each technique. All techniques were capable of resolving the two fibre populations down to a crossing angle of 45 degrees , and down to 30 degrees for super-CSD. A bias was observed in the fibre orientations estimated by QBI for crossing angles other than 90 degrees, consistent with previous simulation results. Finally, for a 45 degrees crossing, the minimum b-value required to resolve the fibre orientations was 4000 s/mm(2) for QBI, 2000 s/mm(2) for CSD, and 1000 s/mm(2) for super-CSD. The quality of estimation of fibre orientations may profoundly affect fibre tracking attempts, and the results presented provide important additional information regarding performance characteristics of well-known methods.},

abstract = {Sleep disruption by painful stimuli is frequently observed both in clinical and experimental conditions. Nociceptive stimuli produce significantly more arousals (30{\%} of stimuli) than non-nociceptive ones. However, even if they do not interrupt sleep, they can trigger a variety of other reactions. Reflex behaviours in response to nociceptive stimuli can be observed during all sleep stages, and are more likely to occur in association with an arousal than alone. Cardiac activation represents a robust sympathetically driven effect preserved whatever the state of vigilance, even if its magnitude can be modulated by a concomitant cortical arousal. Not withstanding these reactions, incorporation of nociceptive stimuli into dream content remains limited. At cortical level, laser-evoked potential studies demonstrate that the processing of nociceptive stimulations is partly conserved during all sleep stages. Furthermore, when nociceptive stimulations interrupt sleep, the cortical response presents a late component suggesting that the stimulation has to be cognitively processed in order to produce a subsequent arousal. More complex reactions to nociceptive stimulations were occasionally reported. In this context, an epileptic patient with intracerebral electrodes implanted for therapeutic purposes allowed us extending these observations. This patient exhibited finger lifts in response to stimulations delivered during paradoxical (REM) sleep. This motor reaction was previously used during wakefulness to indicate that the stimulation had been perceived. When these finger lifts occurred a systematic re-activation of the anterior cingulate preceded each movement. This observation suggests that during PS, not only the processing of sensory inputs but also the capacity for the sleeper to intentionally indicate his perception could be preserved under particular circumstances.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) is an effective treatment option for intractable trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The incidence of trigeminal nerve dysfunction, such as facial numbness or dysesthesia, has been reported to be higher than previously published, and the degree and prognosis of trigeminal nerve dysfunction has not been well evaluated. The authors evaluated the incidence, timing, degree, and outcome of trigeminal nerve dysfunction after GKS for TN. METHODS: One hundred four patients with medically refractory TN were treated by GKS. Thirty-nine patients were men and 65 were women; their median age at GKS was 74 years. Using a single isocenter and a 4-mm collimator, 80 or 90 Gy was directed to the trigeminal nerve root. Follow-up data were obtained at clinical examinations every 3-6 months after GKS. Each patient's pain-control status and degree of trigeminal nerve dysfunction were recorded. The incidence, timing, and degree of dysfunction (assessed using the Barrow Neurological Institute facial numbness scale [BNI-N]) and the prognosis and factors related to trigeminal nerve dysfunction were analyzed. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up in these patients was 37 months (range 6-121 months). At the final clinical visit, a pain-free status was still observed in 71 patients (68.3{\%}). In 51 patients (49.0{\%}), new or increased trigeminal nerve dysfunction developed at a median of 10.5 months (range 4-68 months) after GKS. In 24 patients (23.1{\%}), this dysfunction was categorized as BNI-N Score II, in 20 patients (19.2{\%}) as BNI-N Score III, and in 7 patients (6.7{\%}) as BNI-N Score IV. Among those patients, 18 patients, including 3 patients with BNI-N Score IV, experienced improvement in nerve dysfunction between 24 and 108 months after GKS (median 52.5 months). At the final clinical visit, 43 patients (41.3{\%}) reported having some trigeminal nerve dysfunction: in 26 patients (25.0{\%}) this was categorized as BNI-N Score II, in 13 patients (12.5{\%}) as BNI-N Score III, and in 4 patients (3.8{\%}) as BNI-N Score IV. The only independent factor that was correlated to all trigeminal nerve dysfunction and also specifically to bothersome trigeminal nerve dysfunction was pain-free status at the final clinic visit. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of trigeminal nerve dysfunction after GKS for TN was 49{\%}. The severity of the dysfunction improved in one-third of the afflicted patients, even in those with severe dysesthesia at long-term follow-up. A strong relationship between TN and good pain control was identified},

abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have shown that changes in brain morphology often accompany chronic pain conditions. However, brain biomarkers that are sensitive and specific to chronic pelvic pain (CPP) have not yet been adequately identified. Using data from the Trans-MAPP Research Network, we examined the changes in brain morphology associated with CPP. We used a multivariate pattern classification approach to detect these changes and to identify patterns that could be used to distinguish participants with CPP from age-matched healthy controls. In particular, we used a linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to differentiate gray matter images from the 2 groups. Regions of positive SVM weight included several regions within the primary somatosensory cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, hippocampus, and amygdala were identified as important drivers of the classification with 73{\%} overall accuracy. Thus, we have identified a preliminary classifier based on brain structure that is able to predict the presence of CPP with a good degree of predictive power. Our regional findings suggest that in individuals with CPP, greater gray matter density may be found in the identified distributed brain regions, which are consistent with some previous investigations in visceral pain syndromes. Future studies are needed to improve upon our identified preliminary classifier with integration of additional variables and to assess whether the observed differences in brain structure are unique to CPP or generalizable to other chronic pain conditions.},

Goal of this investigation was to identify potential functional connectivity (FC) differences in the salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN) between fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and controls (HC) and to evaluate the diagnostic applicability of derived pattern classification approaches.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The resting period during an fMRI examination was retrospectively analyzed in women with FMS (n = 17), RA (n = 16), and HC (n = 17). FC was calculated for SN and DMN subregions. Classification accuracies of discriminative MVPA models were evaluated with cross-validation: (1) inferential test of a single method, (2) explorative model optimization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No inferentially tested model was able to classify subjects with statistically significant accuracy. However, the diagnostic ability for the differential diagnostic problem exhibited a trend to significance (accuracy: 69.7{\%}, P = .086). Optimized models in the explorative analysis reached accuracies up to 73.5{\%} (FMS vs. HC), 78.8{\%} (RA vs. HC), and 78.8{\%} (FMS vs. RA) whereas other models performed at or below chance level. Comparable support vector machine approaches performed above average for all three problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Observed accuracies are not sufficient to reliably differentiate between FMS and RA for diagnostic purposes. However, some indirect evidence in support of the feasibility of this approach is provided. This exploratory analysis constitutes a fundamental model optimization effort to be based on in further investigations.},

abstract = {Little is known about the neural connectivity of the fornix in the human brain. In the current study, using diffusion tensor imaging, we attempted to investigate the neural connectivity of the posterior body of the fornix in the normal human brain. A total of 43 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. DTIs were acquired using a sensitivity-encoding head coil at 1.5T. For connectivity of the posterior body of the fornix, a seed region of interest was used on the posterior body of the fornix. Connectivity was defined as the incidence of connection between the posterior body of the fornix and any neural structure of the brain at the threshold of 5, 25, and 50 streamline. At the threshold of 5, 25, and 50, the posterior body of the fornix showed connectivity to the precentral gyrus (37{\%}, 19{\%}, and 15{\%}), the postcentral gyrus (25{\%}, 11.5{\%}, and 7{\%}), the posterior parietal cortex (16.5{\%}, 5{\%}, and 5{\%}), the brainstem (12{\%}, 4.5{\%}, and 3.5{\%}), the crus of the fornix (34{\%}, 10.5{\%}, and 7{\%}), the contralateral splenium of the corpus callosum (12.5{\%}, 5{\%}, and 0{\%}), and the ipsilateral splenium of the CC (69.8{\%}{\%}, 33.7{\%}, and 23.3{\%}), respectively. Findings of this study showed that the posterior body of the fornix had connectivity with the cerebral cortex, the brainstem, the fornical crus, and the contralateral splenium through the splenium of the corpus callosum in normal subjects. We believe that the results of this study would be helpful in investigation of the neural network related to memory and recovery mechanisms following fornical injury in the human brain.},

abstract = {This study describes a new technique for Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) that acquires axial (transverse) images of the cervical spinal cord. The DTI images depict axonal fiber orientation, enable quantification of diffusion characteristics along the spinal cord, and have the potential to demonstrate the connectivity of cord white matter tracts. Because of the high sensitivity to motion of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and the small size of the spinal cord, a fast imaging method with high in-plane resolution was developed. Images were acquired with a single-shot EPI technique, named ZOOM-EPI (zonally magnified oblique multislice echo planar imaging), which selects localized areas and reduces artefacts caused by susceptibility changes between soft tissue and the adjacent vertebrae. Cardiac gating was used to reduce pulsatile flow artefacts from the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid. Voxel resolution was 1.25 x 1.25 mm(2) in-plane with 5-mm slice thickness. Both the mean diffusivity (MD) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) indices of the cervical spinal cord were measured. The FA index demonstrated high anisotropy of the spinal cord with an average value of 0.61 +/- 0.05 (highest value of 0.66 +/- 0.03 at C3), comparable to white matter tracts in the brain. The diffusivity components parallel and orthogonal to the longitudinal axes of the cord were lambda( parallel) = (1648 +/- 123) x 10(-6) mm(2)s(-1) and lambda( perpendicular) = (570 +/- 47) x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1), respectively. The high axial resolution allowed preliminary evaluation of fiber connectivity using the fast-marching tractography algorithm, which generated traces of fiber paths consistent with the well-known cord anatomy.},

abstract = {This magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based morphometric analysis of cortical topography in the human brain is based upon the segmentation and parcellation of volumetric T1-weighted MRI data for a set of 20 young adult brains including 10 males and 10 females. For the most part, each parcellation unit (PU) of the neocortex corresponds to a single or a portion of a single gyrus. The volumes of each PU were computed for each brain. Subsets of PUs were also grouped so as to represent the neocortex for the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. The coefficient of variation of the mean volume of total neocortex and that of the neocortex assigned to individual lobes cluster around 10{\%}, whereas that of neocortex assigned to the individual gyri (PU) is more than twice that value. Approximately 80{\%} of the total variance in gyral volume arises from determinants interactive for individual and specific gyri, while only approximately 10{\%} of the total variance appears to be a reflection of uniform scaling to total neocortical volume. Sexual dimorphism contributes a pervasive though relatively small component of this variance. These results have implications for the study of structure-function correlation, and the proper statistical methods of handling volumetric data in morphometric studies. In addition, the nature of the covariance structure of the data will lead to future hypotheses regarding the relationships between the various potential genetic and epigenetic gyral influencing factors.},

@article{Gustin2011,
abstract = {Trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are thought to have fundamentally different etiologies. It has been proposed that TNP arises through damage to, or pressure on, somatosensory afferents in the trigeminal nerve, whereas TMD results primarily from peripheral nociceptor activation. Because some reports suggest that neuropathic pain is associated with changes in brain anatomy, it is possible that TNP is maintained by changes in higher brain structures, whereas TMD is not. The aim of this investigation is to determine whether changes in regional brain anatomy and biochemistry occur in both conditions. Twenty-one TNP subjects, 20 TMD subjects, and 36 healthy controls were recruited. Voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted anatomical images revealed no significant regional gray matter volume change in TMD patients. In contrast, gray matter volume of TNP patients was reduced in the primary somatosensory cortex, anterior insula, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and the thalamus, whereas gray matter volume was increased in the posterior insula. The thalamic volume decrease was only seen in the TNP patients classified as having trigeminal neuropathy but not those with trigeminal neuralgia. Furthermore, in trigeminal neuropathy patients, magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a significant reduction in the N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio, a biochemical marker of neural viability, in the region of thalamic volume loss. The data suggest that the pathogenesis underlying neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain conditions are fundamentally different and that neuropathic pain conditions that result from peripheral injuries may be generated and/or maintained by structural changes in regions such as the thalamus},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and there is no cure. DNA repair activity is deficient in AD patient brains, especially DNA polymerase $\beta$ (Pol$\beta$), a key protein in DNA base excision. NAD+ is a cellular metabolite critical for mitochondrial health and biogenesis, stem cell self-renewal, and neuronal stress resistance. This study shows that NAD+ levels were decreased in a new AD mouse model with introduced DNA repair deficiency (3xTgAD/Pol$\beta$+/−), and NAD+ supplementation with nicotinamide riboside significantly normalized neuroinflammation, synaptic transmission, phosphorylated Tau, and DNA damage as well as improved learning and memory and motor function. This has implications for human AD intervention.

Emerging findings suggest that compromised cellular bioenergetics and DNA repair contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their role in disease-defining pathology is unclear. We developed a DNA repair-deficient 3xTgAD/Pol$\beta$+/− mouse that exacerbates major features of human AD including phosphorylated Tau (pTau) pathologies, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and cognitive impairment. Here we report that 3xTgAD/Pol$\beta$+/− mice have a reduced cerebral NAD+/NADH ratio indicating impaired cerebral energy metabolism, which is normalized by nicotinamide riboside (NR) treatment. NR lessened pTau pathology in both 3xTgAD and 3xTgAD/Pol$\beta$+/− mice but had no impact on amyloid $\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$) accumulation. NR-treated 3xTgAD/Pol$\beta$+/− mice exhibited reduced DNA damage, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and increased activity of SIRT3 in the brain. NR improved cognitive function in multiple behavioral tests and restored hippocampal synaptic plasticity in 3xTgAD mice and 3xTgAD/Pol$\beta$+/− mice. In general, the deficits between genotypes and the benefits of NR were greater in 3xTgAD/Pol$\beta$+/− mice than in 3xTgAD mice. Our findings suggest a pivotal role for cellular NAD+ depletion upstream of neuroinflammation, pTau, DNA damage, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal degeneration in AD. Interventions that bolster neuronal NAD+ levels therefore have therapeutic potential for AD.},

For four of the disabled subjects classification accuracies of 100{\%} are obtained. The bitrates obtained for the disabled subjects range between 10 and 25 bits/min. The effect of different electrode configurations and machine learning algorithms on classification accuracy is tested.

This latter group provides a unique opportunity to investigate associations between cortical morphology and phonological decoding deficits in individuals without attendant reading comprehension deficits. We predicted widespread reductions in gray matter thickness and brain size in temporal and frontal regions in poor readers, and more focal differences in brain morphology in resilient readers. Typical asymmetry of gray matter thickness in the temporo-parietal region was reduced in both poor and resilient readers. Poor readers also exhibited smaller brain sizes in the right inferior frontal region than both proficient and resilient readers. Altered asymmetry in the temporo-parietal region may therefore be associated with poor phonological decoding and impaired text comprehension may be associated with altered frontal morphology. Resilient readers show relatively focal behavioral differences from typical readers, so it is interesting that they show reliable differences in brain morphology.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior thalamic nucleus (AN), an important relay in the circuitry of memory, is currently being proposed as a treatment for epilepsy. Despite the encouraging results with the use of this therapy, potential benefits and adverse effects are yet to be determined. We show that AN stimulation at relatively high current disrupted the acquisition of contextual fear conditioning and impaired performance on a spatial alternating task in rats. This has not been observed at parameters generating a charge density that approximated the one used in clinical practice. At settings that impaired behavior, AN stimulation induced a functional depolarization block nearby the electrode, increased c-Fos expression in cerebral regions projecting to and receiving projections from the AN, and influenced hippocampal activity. This suggests that complex mechanisms might be involved in the effects of AN DBS, including a local target inactivation and the modulation of structures at a distance. Though translating data from animals to humans has to be considered with caution, our study underscores the need for carefully monitoring memory function while selecting stimulation parameters during the clinical evaluation of AN DBS.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Radiofrequency lesioning is one of the frequently used modalities for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Easily identifiable radiological landmarks are necessary for correct intra-operative localization of foramen ovale.

METHODS: One hundred and seventy sides of dry skulls were studied for the following measurements. D-1: the transverse distance between the apex of the petrous temporal and the centre of the foramen ovale. D-2: the transverse distance from the midline to the centre of the foramen ovale. The distances between the centre of the foramen ovale and, D-3: the anterior margin of mandibular fossa, D-4: centre of the mandibular fossa and D-5: point at the junction of posterior margin and floor of the sella. D-6: the vertical distance between the centre of the foramen ovale and point at the junction of posterior margin and floor of the sella.

RESULTS: The mean values measured were D-1: 13.9 mm, D-2: 24.5 mm, D-3: 3.1 mm, D-4: 11.4 mm, D-5: 0.75 and D-6: 12.42 mm. In majority of cases the centre of foramen was around 25 mm from midline. Additionally the centre of the foramen was at the level of the junction of the posterior wall and floor of the sella or within 2 mm of this point in the antero-posterior direction. In most (81{\%}) cases the vertical displacement of the foramen was 1-1.5 cm inferior to this point.

CONCLUSION: During intra-operative imaging, the midline of the skull and the junction of the posterior wall and floor of the sella can be used as reliable landmarks for the identification of foramen ovale.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has been increasingly used in imaging neuroscience over the last decade. An early form of this technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was rapidly implemented by major MRI scanner companies as a scanner selling point. Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, DTI was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, DTI is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved DW-MRI methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual fiber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of DTI, we review the physics of DW-MRI, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results. We conclude with a list of 'Do's and Don'ts' which define good practice in this expanding area of imaging neuroscience.},

abstract = {The development of a brain template for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is crucial for comparisons of neuronal structural integrity and brain connectivity across populations, as well as for the development of a white matter atlas. Previous efforts to produce a DTI brain template have been compromised by factors related to image quality, the effectiveness of the image registration approach, the appropriateness of subject inclusion criteria, and the completeness and accuracy of the information summarized in the final template. The purpose of this work was to develop a DTI human brain template using techniques that address the shortcomings of previous efforts. Therefore, data containing minimal artifacts were first obtained on 67 healthy human subjects selected from an age-group with relatively similar diffusion characteristics (20-40 years of age), using an appropriate DTI acquisition protocol. Non-linear image registration based on mean diffusion-weighted and fractional anisotropy images was employed. DTI brain templates containing median and mean tensors were produced in ICBM-152 space and made publicly available. The resulting set of DTI templates is characterized by higher image sharpness, provides the ability to distinguish smaller white matter fiber structures, contains fewer image artifacts, than previously developed templates, and to our knowledge, is one of only two templates produced based on a relatively large number of subjects. Furthermore, median tensors were shown to better preserve the diffusion characteristics at the group level than mean tensors. Finally, white matter fiber tractography was applied on the template and several fiber-bundles were traced.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four healthy male volunteers were examined in this study. Diffusion tensor images were acquired on a 3T clinical magnetic resonance scanner using PROPELLER and echo planar imaging sequences in six motion-probing gradient orientations. Fiber tracking results for the trigeminal and auditory nerves were compared quantitatively. RESULTS: The trigeminal nerve tract was successfully reconstructed using both acquisition methods (100{\%}). Among these reconstructed tracts, 62.5{\%} of the tracts on PROPELLER-DTT and 25{\%} on ssEPI-DTT were followed to branches beyond the trigeminal ganglion. The reconstructed auditory nerve tract could be identified on PROPELER-DTT (62.5{\%}), whereas no tract or only a short tract was obtained on ssEPI-DTT (37.5{\%}). CONCLUSION: 3T PROPELLER-DTT is useful for visualizing infratentorial small neurofiber structures},

abstract = {The original concept of the NAD World was proposed in 2009, providing a comprehensive framework to investigate critical issues of biological robustness and trade-offs in mammalian aging and longevity control. Significant progress has been made over the past 7 years, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which biological robustness is maintained, and providing extensive support to the concept of the NAD World. Three key organs and tissues have been identified as basic elements in this control system for mammalian aging and longevity: the hypothalamus as the control center of aging, skeletal muscle as an effector, and adipose tissue as a modulator. While the hypothalamus sends a signal to skeletal muscle through the sympathetic nervous system, adipose tissue remotely regulates hypothalamic function by coordinating NAD(+) biosynthesis at a systemic level. Skeletal muscle might also communicate with other organs and tissues by secreting various myokines. The mammalian NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 and the key NAD(+) biosynthetic enzyme NAMPT mediate these inter-tissue communications. In this review, the function of each organ or tissue and their inter-tissue communications will be discussed in terms of understanding mammalian aging and longevity control. With such an emphasis on the system architecture, the concept is now reformulated as the NAD World 2.0, providing several important predictions. The concept of the NAD World 2.0 will provide a new foundation to understand a control system for mammalian aging and longevity and accelerate the development of an effective anti-aging intervention for humans.},

abstract = {We used event-related functional MRI to study awareness of prior episodes during memory retrieval and its relationship to the intention to retrieve memories. Participants completed cues with words from a prior list (intentional test) or with the first words that came to mind (incidental test). During both tests, explicit memory was separated from priming in the absence of explicit memory. Priming was associated with hemodynamic decreases in left fusiform gyrus and bilateral frontal and occipital brain regions; explicit memory was associated with bilateral parietal and temporal and left frontal increases. Retrieval intention did not change these patterns but was associated with activity in right prefrontal cortex. Our results provide firm evidence that implicit and explicit memory have distinct functional neuroanatomies, and that strategic control of retrieval engages brain structures distinct from those involved in both implicit and explicit memory. They have critical implications for theories of memory and consciousness, which often equate consciousness with control.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The aim of the current study was to examine and compare the aftereffects of local high-frequency microstimulation through the recording electrode on the firing of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation. Deep brain stimulation has been playing an increasing role in the treatment of Parkinson disease, with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) being the preferred implantation target. Changes in cellular activity indicative of the borders of the STN are typically used during surgery to determine the extent of the STN and locate the optimal target, but in some cases borders may be difficult to identify. In this study the authors compared the effects of microstimulation in the SNr and STN. In previous studies they have shown that microstimulation in the internal globus pallidus, which is functionally similar to the SNr, inhibits firing, whereas similar microstimulation in the STN has minimal effect. The presence of inhibition in the SNr but not in the STN could be used as an additional criterion to help identify the location of the border between the STN and SNr. METHODS: Dual microelectrode recordings were performed during stereotactic surgery in 4 patients. Well-isolated high-amplitude units were stimulated extracellularly through the recording microelectrode with 0.5-second trains of high frequency (200 Hz) and low current ({\textless}or= 5 microA). RESULTS: In the majority (92{\%}) of SNr neurons, this type of stimulation led to a period of inhibition lasting several hundreds of milliseconds following the end of the train. In contrast, only 1 neuron of 70 judged to be in the STN by other criteria was inhibited by this type of microstimulation, and this neuron was located at the ventral border of the STN. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that prolonged inhibition of firing following low-amplitude high-frequency microstimulation via the recording electrode is a consistent feature of almost all SNr neurons and rarely if ever occurs in STN neurons. This feature therefore provides a useful additional finding that can be used to help identify the border between the STN and SNr.},

@article{Crichton2017,
abstract = {Background: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in biomedical text mining. Accurate NER systems require task-specific, manually-annotated datasets, which are expensive to develop and thus limited in size. Since such datasets contain related but different information, an interesting question is whether it might be possible to use them together to improve NER performance. To investigate this, we develop supervised, multi-task, convolutional neural network models and apply them to a large number of varied existing biomedical named entity datasets. Additionally, we investigated the effect of dataset size on performance in both single-and multi-task settings. Results: We present a single-task model for NER, a Multi-output multi-task model and a Dependent multi-task model. We apply the three models to 15 biomedical datasets containing multiple named entities including Anatomy, Chemical, Disease, Gene/Protein and Species. Each dataset represent a task. The results from the single-task model and the multi-task models are then compared for evidence of benefits from Multi-task Learning. With the Multi-output multi-task model we observed an average F-score improvement of 0.8{\%} when compared to the single-task model from an average baseline of 78.4{\%}. Although there was a significant drop in performance on one dataset, performance improves significantly for five datasets by up to 6.3{\%}. For the Dependent multi-task model we observed an average improvement of 0.4{\%} when compared to the single-task model. There were no significant drops in performance on any dataset, and performance improves significantly for six datasets by up to 1.1{\%}. The dataset size experiments found that as dataset size decreased, the multi-output model's performance increased compared to the single-task model's. Using 50, 25 and 10{\%} of the training data resulted in an average drop of approximately 3.4, 8 and 16.7{\%} respectively for the single-task model but approximately 0.2, 3.0 and 9.8{\%} for the multi-task model. Conclusions: Our results show that, on average, the multi-task models produced better NER results than the single-task models trained on a single NER dataset. We also found that Multi-task Learning is beneficial for small datasets. Across the various settings the improvements are significant, demonstrating the benefit of Multi-task Learning for this task.},

abstract = {Object Vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve is the most common factor associated with the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Microvascular decompression (MVD) has proven to be the most successful and durable surgical approach for this disorder. However, not all patients with TN manifest unequivocal neurovascular compression (NVC). Furthermore, over time patients with an initially successful MVD manifest a relentless rate of TN recurrence. Methods The authors performed a retrospective review of cases of TN Type 1 (TN1) or Type 2 (TN2) involving patients 18 years or older who underwent evaluation (and surgery when indicated) at Oregon Health {\&} Science University between July 2006 and February 2013. Surgical and imaging findings were correlated. Results The review identified a total of 257 patients with TN (219 with TN1 and 38 with TN2) who underwent high-resolution MRI and MR angiography with 3D reconstruction of combined images using OsiriX. Imaging data revealed that the occurrence of TN1 and TN2 without NVC was 28.8{\%} and 18.4{\%}, respectively. A subgroup of 184 patients underwent surgical exploration. Imaging findings were highly correlated with surgical findings, with a sensitivity of 96{\%} for TN1 and TN2 and a specificity of 90{\%} for TN1 and 66{\%} for TN2. Conclusions Magnetic resonance imaging detects NVC with a high degree of sensitivity. However, despite a diagnosis of TN1 or TN2, a significant number of patients have no NVC. Trigeminal neuralgia clearly occurs and recurs in the absence of NVC.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel deformable registration algorithm for diffusion tensor MR images that enables explicit optimization of tensor reorientation. The optimization seeks a piecewise affine transformation that divides the image domain into uniform regions and transform each region affinely. The objective function captures both the image similarity and the smoothness of the transformation across region boundaries. The image similarity enables explicit orientation optimization by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary for warping diffusion tensor images. The objective function is formulated in a way that allows explicit implementation of analytic derivatives to drive fast and accurate optimization using the conjugate gradient method. By explicitly optimizing tensor reorientation, the algorithm is designed to take advantage of similarity measures comparing tensors as a whole. The optimal transformation is hierarchically refined in a subdivision framework. A comparison with affine registration for inter-subject normalization of 8 subjects shows that the proposed algorithm improves the alignment of several major white matter structures examined: the anterior thalamic radiations, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, the corticospinal/corticobulbar tracts and the genu and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The alignment of white matter structures is assessed using a novel scheme of computing distances between the corresponding fiber bundles derived from tractography. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The afferent visual pathway is commonly affected in MS. Assessment of the afferent visual pathway using clinical, imaging and electrophysiological methods not only provides insights into the pathophysiology of MS, but also provides a method of investigating potential therapeutic measures in MS. This review summarises the various assessment methods, in particular imaging techniques of the visual pathway. Retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness is usually reduced following an episode of optic neuritis. Techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy are used to quantify RNFL thickness. MRI of the optic nerve is not routinely used in the diagnosis of MS or optic neuritis, but is valuable in atypical cases and in research. T2- weighted images of the optic nerve usually show the hyperintense lesion in optic neuritis and gadolinium enhancement is seen in the acute attack. Quantifying atrophy of the optic nerve using MRI gives an indication of the degree of axonal loss. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of the optic nerve provides an indication of myelination. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the optic nerve and optic radiation provide information about the integrity of the visual white matter tracts. Functional MRI following visual stimulation is used to assess the contribution of cortical reorganisation to functional recovery following optic neuritis. Investigations including logMAR visual acuity, Sloan contrast acuity, Farnsworth- Munsell 100-hue colour vision tests and Humphrey perimetry provide detailed quantitative information on different aspects of visual function. Visual evoked potentials identify conduction block or delay reflecting demyelination. These collective investigative methods have advanced knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms in MS and optic neuritis. Relevant ongoing studies and future directions are discussed},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Functional neuroimaging has made a huge impact scientifically, not least within the field of pain research. The noninvasive identification of pain mechanisms that underpin chronicity, such as central sensitization and other amplification processes related to the cognitive or emotional state of the patient, is of considerable interest to the clinical pain community and pharmaceutical industry. Relating data to a person's specific pain report or measure of pain relief provide a clearer understanding of the mechanisms driving and maintaining this complex experience. It is timely, therefore, to review the advances in neuroimaging applications to pain. RECENT FINDINGS: New data have emerged to further support the descending modulatory system's critical role in chronic pain. The neural correlates that underpin tonic, ongoing and spontaneous pain in patients are being identified. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex is emerging as a critical brain region for pain processing, especially in patients. Finally, data from structural and molecular imaging studies are highlighting the extent of damage the brain sustains when patients live with their chronicity unrelieved. SUMMARY: Neuroimaging tools have advanced our understanding of central pain mechanisms in normals and patients, forcing us to reconsider issues related to diagnosis and provision of treatment},

abstract = {This work proposes a new method to detect abnormalities in fiber bundles of first-episode (FE) schizophrenia patients. Existing methods have either examined a particular region of interest or used voxel-based morphometry or used tracts generated using the single tensor model for locating statistically different fiber bundles. Further, a two-sample t test, which assumes a Gaussian distribution for each population, is the most widely used statistical hypothesis testing algorithm. In this study, we use the unscented Kalman filter based two-tensor tractography algorithm for tracing neural fiber bundles of the brain that connect 105 different cortical and subcortical regions. Next, fiber bundles with significant connectivity across the entire population were determined. Several diffusion measures derived from the two-tensor model were computed and used as features in the subsequent analysis. For each fiber bundle, an affine-invariant descriptor was computed, thus obviating the need for precise registration of patients to an atlas. A kernel-based statistical hypothesis testing algorithm, which makes no assumption regarding the distribution of the underlying population, was then used to determine the abnormal diffusion properties of all fiber bundles for 20 FE patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Of the 1254 fiber bundles with significant connectivity, 740 fiber bundles were found to be significantly different in at least one diffusion measure after correcting for multiple comparisons. Thus, the changes affecting first-episode patients seem to be global in nature (spread throughout the brain)},

abstract = {Idiosyncrasies of trigeminal neuralgia provide both clues and constraints on candidate hypotheses concerning the underlying neural mechanism. After reviewing the key clinical aspects of the disease, we propose here a novel hypothesis based on recent findings from experimental nerve-injury preparations. The hypothesis states that trigger stimuli set off bursts of activity in a small cluster of trigeminal ganglion (TRG) neurons that have been rendered hyperexcitable as a result of TRG or trigeminal root damage. Activity then spreads from this "TRG ignition focus" to encompass more widespread portions of the ganglion. After a brief period of autonomous firing (seconds to minutes), activity is quenched and a refractory period is initiated by an intrinsic suppressive (hyperpolarizing) process engaged as a result of the rapid firing. The primary abnormality resides in the TRG and trigeminal root, rather than in the skin or the CNS. Because of this, sensation is essentially normal between periods of ectopic paroxysmal TRG discharge. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Human association studies of common genetic polymorphisms have identified many loci that are associated with risk of complex diseases, although individual loci typically have small effects. However, by envisaging genetic associations in terms of cellular pathways, rather than any specific polymorphism, combined effects of many biologically relevant alleles can be detected. The effects are likely to be most apparent in investigations of phenotypically homogenous subtypes of complex diseases. We report findings from a case-control, genetic association study of relationships between 2925 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2 subtypes of a commonly occurring chronic facial pain condition, temporomandibular disorder (TMD): 1) localized TMD and 2) TMD with widespread pain. When compared to healthy controls, cases with localized TMD differed in allelic frequency of SNPs that mapped to a serotonergic receptor pathway (P=0.0012), while cases of TMD with widespread pain differed in allelic frequency of SNPs that mapped to a T-cell receptor pathway (P=0.0014). A risk index representing combined effects of 6 SNPs from the serotonergic pathway was associated with greater odds of localized TMD (odds ratio 2.7, P=1.3 E-09), and the result was reproduced in a replication case-control cohort study of 639 people (odds ratio 1.6, P=0.014). A risk index representing combined effects of 8 SNPs from the T-cell receptor pathway was associated with greater odds of TMD with widespread pain (P=1.9 E-08), although the result was not significant in the replication cohort. These findings illustrate potential for clinical classification of chronic pain based on distinct molecular profiles and genetic background.},

abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that empathy for pain is underpinned by neural structures that are also involved in the direct experience of pain. In order to assess the consistency of this finding, an image-based meta-analysis of nine independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations and a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 32 studies that had investigated empathy for pain using fMRI were conducted. The results indicate that a core network consisting of bilateral anterior insular cortex and medial/anterior cingulate cortex is associated with empathy for pain. Activation in these areas overlaps with activation during directly experienced pain, and we link their involvement to representing global feeling states and the guidance of adaptive behavior for both self- and other-related experiences. Moreover, the image-based analysis demonstrates that depending on the type of experimental paradigm this core network was co-activated with distinct brain regions: While viewing pictures of body parts in painful situations recruited areas underpinning action understanding (inferior parietal/ventral premotor cortices) to a stronger extent, eliciting empathy by means of abstract visual information about the other's affective state more strongly engaged areas associated with inferring and representing mental states of self and other (precuneus, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, and temporo-parietal junction). In addition, only the picture-based paradigms activated somatosensory areas, indicating that previous discrepancies concerning somatosensory activity during empathy for pain might have resulted from differences in experimental paradigms. We conclude that social neuroscience paradigms provide reliable and accurate insights into complex social phenomena such as empathy and that meta-analyses of previous studies are a valuable tool in this endeavor. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors' goal was to observe histopathological changes in the trigeminal nerve after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in rhesus monkeys, and to investigate the radiobiological mechanism of GKS for primary trigeminal neuralgia. The nerve length-dosage effect of irradiation is also discussed.

METHODS: One of 5 rhesus monkeys randomly served as a control, and the other 4 monkeys were randomly administered a target radiation dose of 60, 70, 80, or 100 Gy (a different dose in each animal). The size of the collimator was 4 mm, and the target point was the trigeminal nerve root. In each experimental monkey, one side was exposed to single-target-point irradiation, and the contralateral side was exposed to double-target-point irradiation. After 6 months, the trigeminal nerve root was examined using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry.

RESULTS: At each radiation dose, the damage to the nerve tissue by single-target-point irradiation was identical to that caused by double-target-point irradiation. In the trigeminal nerve tissues of the monkeys irradiated with 60 and 70 Gy, there was limited nerve demyelination and degeneration, fragmentation, or loss of axons. In the trigeminal nerve tissue of the monkey irradiated with 80 Gy, the nerve tissue showed a disordered structure. In the trigeminal nerve tissue of the monkey irradiated with 100 Gy, there was severe derangement in the structure of the nerve tissue, and extensive demyelination, fragmentation, and loss of axons.

CONCLUSIONS: The target doses of 60 and 70 Gy have very little impact on the structure of the trigeminal nerve. Irradiation at 80 Gy can cause partial degeneration and loss of axons and demyelination. A 100-Gy dose can cause some necrosis of neurons. Comparing the single-target-point with the double-target-point irradiation, the extent of damage to the nerve tissue is identical, and no difference in the nerve length-dosage effect was found.},

abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts) in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically along each tract for several reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in the brains of typically developing children and children at risk for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First, fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects. Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare white matter properties of individual patients to standardized Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation, AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical management and decision-making.},

abstract = {Humans commonly understand the unobservable mental states of others by observing their actions. Embodied simulation theories suggest that this ability may be based in areas of the fronto-parietal mirror neuron system, yet neuroimaging studies that explicitly investigate the human ability to draw mental state inferences point to the involvement of a {\&}{\#}x201C;mentalizing" system consisting of regions that do not overlap with the mirror neuron system. For the present study, we developed a novel action identification paradigm that allowed us to explicitly investigate the neural bases of mentalizing observed actions. Across repeated viewings of a set of ecologically valid video clips of ordinary human actions, we manipulated the extent to which participants identified the unobservable mental states of the actor (mentalizing) or the observable mechanics of their behavior (mechanizing). Although areas of the mirror neuron system did show an enhanced response during action identification, its activity was not significantly modulated by the extent to which the observers identified mental states. Instead, several regions of the mentalizing system, including dorsal and ventral aspects of medial pFC, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporal poles, were associated with mentalizing actions, whereas a single region in left lateral occipito-temporal cortex was associated with mechanizing actions. These data suggest that embodied simulation is insufficient to account for the sophisticated mentalizing that human beings are capable of while observing another and that a different system along the cortical midline and in anterior temporal cortex is involved in mentalizing an observed action.},

It was demonstrated that noninvasive EEG-based BCIs allow brain-derived communication in paralyzed and locked-in patients but not in completely locked-in patients. At present no firm conclusion about the clinical utility of BCI for the control of voluntary movement can be made. Invasive multielectrode BCIs in otherwise healthy animals allowed execution of reaching, grasping, and force variations based on spike patterns and extracellular field potentials.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the discoveries underpinning the introduction of cerebral PET scanning and highlight its modern applications. BACKGROUND: Important discoveries in neurophysiology, brain metabolism, and radiotracer development in the post-World War II period provided the necessary infrastructure for the first cerebral PET scan. METHODS: A complete review of the literature was undertaken to search for primary and secondary sources on the history of PET imaging. Searches were performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and select individual journal Web sites. Written autobiographies were obtained through the Society for Neuroscience Web site at www.sfn.org. A reference book on the history of radiology, Naked to the Bone, was reviewed to corroborate facts and to locate references. The references listed in all the articles and books obtained were reviewed. RESULTS: The neurophysiologic sciences required to build cerebral PET imaging date back to 1878. The last 60 years have produced an evolution of technological advancements in brain metabolism and radiotracer development. These advancements facilitated the development of modern cerebral PET imaging. Several key scientists were involved in critical discoveries and among them were Angelo Mosso, Charles Roy, Charles Sherrington, John Fulton, Seymour Kety, Louis Sokoloff, David E. Kuhl, Gordon L. Brownell, Michael Ter-Pogossian, Michael Phelps, and Edward Hoffman. CONCLUSIONS: Neurophysiology, metabolism, and radiotracer development in the postwar era synergized the development of the technology necessary for cerebral PET scanning. Continued use of PET in clinical trials and current developments in PET-CT/MRI hybrids has led to advancement in diagnosis, management, and treatment of neurologic disorders.},

@article{Carriedo2000,
abstract = {The reason for the selective vulnerability of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is primarily unknown. A possible factor is the expression by motor neurons of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA/kainate channels, which may permit rapid Ca(2+) influx in response to synaptic receptor activation. However, other subpopulations of central neurons, most notably forebrain GABAergic interneurons, consistently express large numbers of these channels but do not degenerate in ALS. Indeed, when subjected to identical excitotoxic exposures, motor neurons were more susceptible than GABAergic neurons to AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity. Microfluorimetric studies were performed to examine the basis for the difference in vulnerability. First, AMPA or kainate exposures appeared to trigger substantial mitochondrial Ca(2+) loading in motor neurons, as indicated by a sharp increase in intracellular Ca(2+) after addition of the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl hydrazone (FCCP) after the agonist exposure. The same exposures caused little mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation in GABAergic cortical neurons. Subsequent experiments examined other measures of mitochondrial function to compare sequelae of AMPA/kainate receptor activation between these populations. Brief exposure to either AMPA or kainate caused mitochondrial depolarization, assessed using tetramethylrhodamine ethylester, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, assessed using hydroethidine, in motor neurons. However, these effects were only seen in the GABAergic neurons after exposure to the nondesensitizing AMPA receptor agonist kainate. Finally, addition of either antioxidants or toxins (FCCP or CN(-)) that block mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake attenuated AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated motor neuron injury, suggesting that the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and consequent ROS generation are central to the injury process.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the patterns of diffusivity associated with cognitive domain functions in older adults without dementia.

METHODS: We studied older adults without dementia (n = 220) who underwent neuropsychometric testing and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination at 3 T in a cross-sectional study. Memory, language, attention/executive function, and visual-spatial processing domains were assessed within 4 months of the MRI examination. A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-based DTI sequence that enabled uncontaminated cortical diffusion measurements was performed. Associations between cortical mean diffusivity (MD) and cognitive function were tested using voxel-based regression analysis. Association between tract diffusivity and cognitive function was tested with regions of interest drawn on color-coded fractional anisotropy (FA) maps.

RESULTS: Memory function was associated with the medial temporal lobe cortical MD on voxel-based analysis (p {\textless} 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus and posterior and anterior cingulum FA on tract-based analysis (p {\textless} 0.001). Language function was associated with the left temporal lobe cortical MD (p {\textless} 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, and posterior cingulum FA (p {\textless} 0.05). Attention and executive function was associated with the posterior and anterior cingulum FA, and visual-spatial function was associated with posterior cingulum FA (p {\textless} 0.01).

CONCLUSION: Specific cognitive domain functions are associated with distinct patterns of cortical and white matter diffusivity in elderly with no dementia. Posterior cingulum tract FA was associated with all 4 cognitive domain functions, in agreement with the hypothesis that the posterior cingulate cortex is the main connectivity hub for cognitive brain networks. Microstructural changes identified on DTI may be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies underlying cognitive changes in older adults without dementia.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors evaluate the impact of target location on the rate of pain relief (PR) in patients with intractable trigeminal neuralgia (TN) undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 99 patients with idiopathic TN who were identified from a prospectively maintained database and were treated with SRS targeting the dorsal root entry zone with a maximum dose of 80 Gy. Targeting of the more proximal portion of a trigeminal nerve with the 50{\%} isodose line overlapping the brainstem was performed in 36 patients (proximal group). In a matched group, 63 patients received SRS targeting the 20{\%} isodose line tangential to the emergence of the brainstem (distal group). The median follow-up time was 33 months (range 6-124 months).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The actuarial rate of maintenance of Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) Pain Score I-IIIa was attained in 89{\%} of patients at 1 year, 81{\%} at 2 years, and 69{\%} at 4 years, respectively, after SRS. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that durability of PR was only associated with the proximal location of the radiosurgical target (log-rank test, p = 0.018). Radiosurgery-induced facial numbness (BNI Score II or III) developed in 35 patients, which was significantly more frequent in the proximal group (19 patients [53{\%}] compared with 16 [25{\%}] in the distal group [p = 0.015]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The radiosurgical target appears to affect the duration of pain relief in patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia with the target closer to the brainstem affording extended pain relief. However, the proximal SRS target was also associated with an increased risk of mild to moderate facial numbness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two of the strongest predictors of later schizophrenia in the Edinburgh High Risk Study (EHRS) were the presence of schizotypal features and increased right prefrontal lobe cortical folding. We examined the association between these measures in adolescents at enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia due to cognitive impairment. METHODS: One hundred forty-three adolescents receiving special education were divided into two groups using the cut-off on the Structured Interview for Schizotypy (SIS) which optimally predicted later schizophrenia in the EHRS. Each participant received a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. Prefrontal tissue volumes and a standard measure of cortical folding, the gyrification index (GI), were determined automatically using automated (A)-GI methodology. RESULTS: Those who scored above the SIS cut-off had a significantly higher right prefrontal lobe GI compared to those below the cut-off (F = 4.72, p = .03). GI correlated strongly with prefrontal tissue volumes, although when prefrontal volume was added as a covariate to the GI analysis a trend towards a group difference remained evident. CONCLUSIONS: The level of schizotypal cognitions among adolescents with cognitive impairment identifies a group with the same pattern of cortical folding seen in those with familial risk factors who later develop the disorder. Increased right prefrontal GI may reflect disordered connectivity in individuals with the greatest risk of developing schizophrenia},

Based on our preliminary observation that the subgenual cingulate region (Brodmann area 25) is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression, we studied whether the application of chronic deep brain stimulation to modulate BA25 could reduce this elevated activity and produce clinical benefit in six patients with refractory depression. Chronic stimulation of white matter tracts adjacent to the subgenual cingulate gyrus was associated with a striking and sustained remission of depression in four of six patients. Antidepressant effects were associated with a marked reduction in local cerebral blood flow as well as changes in downstream limbic and cortical sites, measured using positron emission tomography. These results suggest that disrupting focal pathological activity in limbic-cortical circuits using electrical stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter can effectively reverse symptoms in otherwise treatment-resistant depression},

On a language modeling task, we present experiments that systematically vary (1) the basic unit of representation, (2) the composition of these representations, and (3) the morphological typology of the language modeled. Our results extend previous findings that character representations are effective across typologies, and we find that a previously unstudied combination of character trigram representations composed with bi-LSTMs outperforms most others. But we also find room for improvement: none of the character-level models match the predictive accuracy of a model with access to true morphological analyses, even when learned from an order of magnitude more data.},

abstract = {Learned helplessness is a maladaptive response to uncontrollable stress characterized by impaired motor escape responses, reduced motivation and learning deficits. There are important individual differences in the likelihood of becoming helpless following exposure to uncontrollable stress but little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these individual differences. Here we used structural MRI to measure gray and white matter in individuals with chronic pain, a population at high risk for helplessness due to prolonged exposure to a poorly controlled stressor (pain). Given that self-reported helplessness is predictive of treatment outcomes in chronic pain, understanding such differences might provide valuable clinical insight. We found that the magnitude of self-reported helplessness correlated with cortical thickness in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and midcingulate cortex, regions implicated in cognitive aspects of motor behavior. We then examined the white matter connectivity of these regions and found that fractional anisotropy of connected white matter tracts along the corticospinal tract was associated with helplessness and mediated the relationship between SMA cortical thickness and helplessness. These data provide novel evidence that links individual differences in the motor output pathway with perceived helplessness over a chronic and poorly controlled stressor.},

abstract = {Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is supposedly caused by an ectatic blood vessel affecting the trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone of the brain stem. Recent evidence suggests an additional central component within trigeminal pain-processing in the pathophysiology of TN. Therefore, we aimed to identify specific brain regions possibly associated with the development or maintenance of TN using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Sixty patients with classical TN were compared to 49 healthy controls. Eighteen patients had TN with concomitant constant facial pain, a condition previously described as a predictor of worse treatment outcome. We found gray matter (GM) volume reduction in TN patients compared to healthy controls in the primary somatosensory and orbitofrontal cortices, as well as the in the secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), cerebellum, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. GM volume decrease within the ACC, parahippocampus, and temporal lobe correlated with increasing disease duration in TN. There were no differences comparing patients with and without concomitant constant facial pain. No GM increase was found comparing patient subgroups with each other and with healthy controls. The observed changes probably reflect the impact of multiple, daily attacks of trigeminal pain in these patients similar to what was previously described in other chronic pain conditions and may be interpreted as adaptation mechanism to chronic pain in regard to neuronal plasticity. The ACC, parahippocampus and temporal lobe volume reduction in parallel with disease duration may point to a pivotal role of these structures in chronic pain.},

abstract = {Representation of time may affect pain perception. We investigated a group of volunteers looking at different clocks while they were being exposed to the same intensity of pain in two experiments. In one case, they saw the actual time, while in the other, they gazed at a clock that made it seem like the stimulation was shortened, even though it wasn't. These results show that simply believing that time is on your side can make anything more bearable. The results were not influenced by the color of the clock (red or green), or the presence of indexes such as (sad or smiling) smileys. The effects were maximal for high intensities of stimulation (pain threshold +1°C) if the stimulation lasted for at least 25s but were absent if the stimulation was short (15 min). These results suggest that pain modulation by time context is mainly available for long and intense painful stimulations. The right upper and posterior parietal cortex may support this effect. These findings are discussed with regard to previous literature of pain modulations but also with regard to the concept of the "pain matrix", its inputs and the temporal dynamics of its constitutive responses.},

abstract = {Analysis of sensory neurons' processing characteristics requires simultaneous measurement of presented stimuli and concurrent spike responses. The functional transformation from high-dimensional stimulus space to the binary space of spike and non-spike responses is commonly described with linear-nonlinear models, whose linear filter component describes the neuron's receptive field. From a machine learning perspective, this corresponds to the binary classification problem of discriminating spike-eliciting from non-spike-eliciting stimulus examples. The classification-based receptive field (CbRF) estimation method proposed here adapts a linear large-margin classifier to optimally predict experimental stimulus-response data and subsequently interprets learned classifier weights as the neuron's receptive field filter. Computational learning theory provides a theoretical framework for learning from data and guarantees optimality in the sense that the risk of erroneously assigning a spike-eliciting stimulus example to the non-spike class (and vice versa) is minimized. Efficacy of the CbRF method is validated with simulations and for auditory spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF) estimation from experimental recordings in the auditory midbrain of Mongolian gerbils. Acoustic stimulation is performed with frequency-modulated tone complexes that mimic properties of natural stimuli, specifically non-Gaussian amplitude distribution and higher-order correlations. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully identifies correct underlying STRFs, even in cases where second-order methods based on the spike-triggered average (STA) do not. Applied to small data samples, the method is shown to converge on smaller amounts of experimental recordings and with lower estimation variance than the generalized linear model and recent information theoretic methods. Thus, CbRF estimation may prove useful for investigation of neuronal processes in response to natural stimuli and in settings where rapid adaptation is induced by experimental design.},

Individual visualized fiber tracts are thus the result of interpolation on a relatively coarse voxel grid, and an infinite number of them may be generated in a given volume by interpolation. This paper aims at creating a level set representation of a fiber bundle to describe this apparent continuum of fibers. It further introduces a coordinate system warped to the fiber bundle geometry, allowing for the definition of geometrically meaningful fiber bundle measures.},

abstract = {Fear conditioning and extinction are basic forms of associative learning that have gained considerable clinical relevance in enhancing our understanding of anxiety disorders and facilitating their treatment. Modern neuroimaging techniques have significantly aided the identification of anatomical structures and networks involved in fear conditioning. On closer inspection, there is considerable variation in methodology and results between studies. This systematic review provides an overview of the current neuroimaging literature on fear conditioning and extinction on healthy subjects, taking into account methodological issues such as the conditioning paradigm. A Pubmed search, as of December 2008, was performed and supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key articles. Two independent reviewers made the final study selection and data extraction. A total of 46 studies on cued fear conditioning and/or extinction on healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed. The influence of specific experimental factors, such as contingency and timing parameters, assessment of conditioned responses, and characteristics of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, on cerebral activation patterns was examined. Results were summarized descriptively. A network consisting of fear-related brain areas, such as amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, is activated independently of design parameters. However, some neuroimaging studies do not report these findings in the presence of methodological heterogeneities. Furthermore, other brain areas are differentially activated, depending on specific design parameters. These include stronger hippocampal activation in trace conditioning and tactile stimulation. Furthermore, tactile unconditioned stimuli enhance activation of pain related, motor, and somatosensory areas. Differences concerning experimental factors may partly explain the variance between neuroimaging investigations on human fear conditioning and extinction and should, therefore, be taken into serious consideration in the planning and the interpretation of research projects.},

In the current study, we used VBM to examine possible cerebral gray matter abnormalities in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to fire. The subjects included 12 victims of a fire disaster with PTSD and 12 matched victims of the same fire without PTSD. Magnetic resonance images were obtained on a 1.5-Tesla General Electric scanner at Central South University, and an entire brain volume of 248 contiguous slices was obtained for each subject. Then, gray matter density in patients with PTSD and control groups was compared by using a VBM approach in SPM2. Group analysis was thresholded at P {\textless} 0.001, uncorrected, at the voxel level. The following three regions of reduced gray matter volume were found in patients with PTSD compared with controls: left hippocampus, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral insular cortex. It was concluded that there are structural abnormalities of the hippocampus, the ACC and the insular cortex in patients with PTSD due to fire. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is thought to be a major contributor to cognitive dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI), however TAI is difficult to diagnose or characterize non-invasively. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in detecting TAI, but direct comparison to histologically-confirmed axonal injury has not been performed. In the current study, mice were imaged with DTI, subjected to a moderate cortical controlled impact injury, and re-imaged 4-6 h and 24 h post-injury. Axonal injury was detected by amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and neurofilament immunohistochemistry in pericontusional white matter tracts. The severity of axonal injury was quantified using stereological methods from APP stained histological sections. Two DTI parameters--axial diffusivity and relative anisotropy--were significantly reduced in the injured, pericontusional corpus callosum and external capsule, while no significant changes were seen with conventional MRI in these regions. The contusion was easily detectable on all MRI sequences. Significant correlations were found between changes in relative anisotropy and the density of APP stained axons across mice and across subregions spanning the spatial gradient of injury. The predictive value of DTI was tested using a region with DTI changes (hippocampal commissure) and a region without DTI changes (anterior commissure). Consistent with DTI predictions, there was histological detection of axonal injury in the hippocampal commissure and none in the anterior commissure. These results demonstrate that DTI is able to detect axonal injury, and support the hypothesis that DTI may be more sensitive than conventional imaging methods for this purpose.},

While considerable advances have been made in our understanding of reward circuits underlying positive reinforcement, less is known about the circuits underlying the hedonic and reinforcing actions of pain relief. We review findings from electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and behavioral studies supporting the concept that the rewarding effect of pain relief requires opioid signaling in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), activation of midbrain dopamine neurons, and the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Understanding of circuits that govern the reward of pain relief may allow the discovery of more effective and satisfying therapies for patients with acute or chronic pain.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has emerged as a unique technique to reveal small anatomical structures of brain by characterizing the diffusion process of water molecules within an image voxel. Combined with fiber tractography techniques, DTI can be further used to reveal white matter fibers and connectivity in the brain non-invasively. The non-human primate brain study provides important supplemental means for human brain exploration since the two species share close anatomical and functional similarities. There is therefore increasing interest in in vivo non-human primate DTI studies. However, several technical challenges need to be addressed to perform non-human primate brain DTI and fiber tractography. We have established an imaging protocol together with a post-acquisition procedure for high-resolution in vivo non-human primate DTI studies using a 3T human clinical scanner. Data acquired with this procedure is appropriate for accurate diffusion tensor quantification and fiber tractography, and is accessible within an acceptable scan time. We investigated in detail the effects of spatial resolution and SNR on diffusion tensor-derived quantities and fiber tractography. Our results should be of general utility for implementation of in vivo non-human primate DTI studies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study patients with chronic neuropathic pain involving the maxillary region (V2) of the trigeminal nerve in patients with spontaneous pain and evoked pain to brush (allodynia). Patients underwent two functional scans (2-3 months apart) with mechanical and thermal stimuli applied to the affected region of V2 and to the mirror site in the unaffected contralateral V2 region, as well as bilaterally to the mandibular (V3) division. Patients were stimulated with brush, noxious cold, and noxious heat. Significant changes were observed in regions within and outside the primary trigeminal sensory pathway. Stimulation to the affected (neuropathic) side resulted in predominantly frontal region and basal ganglia activation compared with the control side. The differences were consistent with the allodynia to brush and cold. A region of interest-based analysis of the trigeminal sensory pathway revealed patterns of activation that differentiated between the affected and unaffected sides and that were particular to each stimulus. Activation in the spinal trigeminal nucleus was constant in location for all pain stimuli. Activation in other brainstem nuclei also showed differences in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal for the affected versus the unaffected side. Thus, sensory processing in patients with trigeminal neuropathic pain is associated with distinct activation patterns consistent with sensitization within and outside of the primary sensory pathway.},

abstract = {Switching between exploratory and defensive behaviour is fundamental to survival of many animals, but how this transition is achieved by specific neuronal circuits is not known. Here, using the converse behavioural states of fear extinction and its context-dependent renewal as a model in mice, we show that bi-directional transitions between states of high and low fear are triggered by a rapid switch in the balance of activity between two distinct populations of basal amygdala neurons. These two populations are integrated into discrete neuronal circuits differentially connected with the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Targeted and reversible neuronal inactivation of the basal amygdala prevents behavioural changes without affecting memory or expression of behaviour. Our findings indicate that switching between distinct behavioural states can be triggered by selective activation of specific neuronal circuits integrating sensory and contextual information. These observations provide a new framework for understanding context-dependent changes of fear behaviour.},

abstract = {Of all cranial nerves, the trigeminal nerve is the largest and the most widely distributed in the supra-hyoid neck. It provides sensory input from the face and motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. In order to adequately image the full course of the trigeminal nerve and its main branches a detailed knowledge of neuroanatomy and imaging technique is required. Although the main trunk of the trigeminal nerve is consistently seen on conventional brain studies, high-resolution tailored imaging is mandatory to depict smaller nerve branches and subtle pathologic processes. Increasing developments in imaging technique made possible isotropic sub-milimetric images and curved reconstructions of cranial nerves and their branches and led to an increasing recognition of symptomatic trigeminal neuropathies. Whereas MRI has a higher diagnostic yield in patients with trigeminal neuropathy, CT is still required to demonstrate the bony anatomy of the skull base and is the modality of choice in the context of traumatic injury to the nerve. Imaging of the trigeminal nerve is particularly cumbersome as its long course from the brainstem nuclei to the peripheral branches and its rich anastomotic network impede, in most cases, a topographic approach. Therefore, except in cases of classic trigeminal neuralgia, in which imaging studies can be tailored to the root entry zone, the full course of the trigeminal nerve has to be imaged. This article provides an update in the most recent advances on MR imaging technique and a segmental imaging approach to the most common pathologic processes affecting the trigeminal nerve.},

It is hoped that brain-machine interfaces can be used to restore the normal sensorimotor functions of the limbs, but so far they have lacked tactile sensation. Here we report the operation of a brain-machine-brain interface (BMBI) that both controls the exploratory reaching movements of an actuator and allows signalling of artificial tactile feedback through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex. Monkeys performed an active exploration task in which an actuator (a computer cursor or a virtual-reality arm) was moved using a BMBI that derived motor commands from neuronal ensemble activity recorded in the primary motor cortex. ICMS feedback occurred whenever the actuator touched virtual objects. Temporal patterns of ICMS encoded the artificial tactile properties of each object. Neuronal recordings and ICMS epochs were temporally multiplexed to avoid interference. Two monkeys operated this BMBI to search for and distinguish one of three visually identical objects, using the virtual-reality arm to identify the unique artificial texture associated with each. These results suggest that clinical motor neuroprostheses might benefit from the addition of ICMS feedback to generate artificial somatic perceptions associated with mechanical, robotic or even virtual prostheses.},

abstract = {The role of the brain in chronic pain conditions remains speculative. We compared brain morphology of 26 chronic back pain (CBP) patients to matched control subjects, using magnetic resonance imaging brain scan data and automated analysis techniques. CBP patients were divided into neuropathic, exhibiting pain because of sciatic nerve damage, and non-neuropathic groups. Pain-related characteristics were correlated to morphometric measures. Neocortical gray matter volume was compared after skull normalization. Patients with CBP showed 5-11{\%} less neocortical gray matter volume than control subjects. The magnitude of this decrease is equivalent to the gray matter volume lost in 10-20 years of normal aging. The decreased volume was related to pain duration, indicating a 1.3 cm3 loss of gray matter for every year of chronic pain. Regional gray matter density in 17 CBP patients was compared with matched controls using voxel-based morphometry and nonparametric statistics. Gray matter density was reduced in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus and was strongly related to pain characteristics in a pattern distinct for neuropathic and non-neuropathic CBP. Our results imply that CBP is accompanied by brain atrophy and suggest that the pathophysiology of chronic pain includes thalamocortical processes.},

abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test-retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values},

abstract = {Highly accurate surface models of the cerebral cortex are becoming increasingly important as tools in the investigation of the functional organization of the human brain. The construction of such models is difficult using current neuroimaging technology due to the high degree of cortical folding. Even single voxel misclassifications can result in erroneous connections being created between adjacent banks of a sulcus, resulting in a topologically inaccurate model. These topological defects cause the cortical model to no longer be homeomorphic to a sheet, preventing the accurate inflation, flattening, or spherical morphing of the reconstructed cortex. Surface deformation techniques can guarantee the topological correctness of a model, but are time-consuming and may result in geometrically inaccurate models. In order to address this need we have developed a technique for taking a model of the cortex, detecting and fixing the topological defects while leaving that majority of the model intact, resulting in a surface that is both geometrically accurate and topologically correct.},

abstract = {Prokineticins (PKs), consisting of PK1 and PK2, are a pair of newly identified regulatory peptides. Two closely related G-protein coupled receptors, PKR1 and PKR2, mediate the signaling of PKs. PKs/PKRs participate in the regulation of diverse biological processes, ranging from development to adult physiology. A number of studies have indicated the involvement of PKs/PKRs in nociception. Here we show that PK2 is a sensitizer for nociception. Intraplantar injection of recombinant PK2 resulted in a strong and localized hyperalgesia with reduced thresholds to nociceptive stimuli. PK2 mobilizes calcium in dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Mice lacking the PK2 gene displayed strong reduction in nociception induced by thermal and chemical stimuli, including capsaicin. However, PK2 mutant mice showed no difference in inflammatory response to capsaicin. As the majority of PK2-responsive DRG neurons also expressed transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) and exhibited sensitivity to capsaicin, TRPV1 is likely a significant downstream molecule of PK2 signaling. Taken together, these results reveal that PK2 sensitize nociception without affecting inflammation.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Each year a greater number of patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) undergo radiosurgery, including a large number of patients who are candidates for microvascular decompression (MVD). METHODS: The case characteristics and outcomes of 117 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The mean patient age was 67.8 years; and the majority (58{\%}) of patients had undergone surgery previously. The dependent variable for all analyses of facial pain was complete pain relief without medication (excellent outcome). Median follow-up duration was 26 months (range 1-48 months). The actuarial rate of achieving and maintaining an excellent outcome was 57{\%} and 55{\%} at 1 and 3 years, respectively, after radiosurgery. A greater percentage of patients who had not previously undergone surgery achieved and maintained excellent outcomes (67{\%} at 1 and 3 years) than that of patients who had undergone prior surgery (51{\%} and 47{\%} at 1 and 3 years, respectively; relative risk [RR] = 1.77, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.13, p = 0.04). New persistent trigeminal dysfunction was noted in 43 patients (37{\%}). Tolerable numbness or paresthesias occurred in 29 patients (25{\%}), whereas bothersome dysesthesias developed in 14 patients (12{\%}). Only a radiation dose of 90 Gy correlated with new trigeminal deficits or dysesthesias (RR = 3.10, 95{\%} CI 1.64-5.81, p {\textless} 0.001). Excellent outcomes in patients with new trigeminal dysfunction were achieved and maintained at rates of 76{\%} and 74{\%} at 1 and 3 years, respectively, after radiosurgery, compared with respective rates of 46{\%} and 42{\%} in patients who did not experience postradiosurgery trigeminal dysfunction (RR = 4.53, 95{\%} CI 2.03-9.95, p {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgical treatment provides complete pain relief for the majority of patients with idiopathic TN. There is a strong correlation between the development of new facial sensory loss and achievement and maintenance of pain relief after this procedure. Because the long-term results of radiosurgery still remain unknown, MVD should continue to be the primary operation for medically fit patients with TN},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord atrophy is a common and clinically relevant characteristic in multiple sclerosis. We aimed to perform a multicenter validation study of mean upper cervical cord area measurements in patients with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls from head MR images and to explore the effect of gadolinium administration on mean upper cervical cord area measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 97 subjects from 3 centers, including 60 patients with multiple sclerosis of different disease types and 37 healthy controls. Both cervical cord and head 3D T1-weighted images were acquired. In 11 additional patients from 1 center, head images before and after gadolinium administration and cervical cord images after gadolinium administration were acquired. The mean upper cervical cord area was compared between cervical cord and head images by using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for both consistency (ICCconsist) and absolute (ICCabs) agreement. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement of mean upper cervical cord area measurements from head and cervical cord images in the entire group (ICCabs = 0.987) and across centers and disease subtypes. The mean absolute difference between the mean upper cervical cord area measured from head and cervical cord images was 2 mm(2) (2.3{\%}). Additionally, excellent agreement was found between the mean upper cervical cord area measured from head images with and without gadolinium administration (ICCabs = 0.991) and between the cervical cord and head images with gadolinium administration (ICCabs = 0.992). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent agreement between mean upper cervical cord area measurements on head and cervical cord images was observed in this multicenter study, implying that upper cervical cord atrophy can be reliably measured from head images. Postgadolinium head or cervical cord images may also be suitable for measuring mean upper cervical cord area.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although compression of the trigeminal nerve by a vascular loop is thought to be the most common cause of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), other aetiologies, such as multiple sclerosis or brainstem infarction may be associated with this disorder. MRI may detect lesions different from vascular loop compression of the trigeminal nerve that may be related to TN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The pre-operative MRIs of 68 patients without the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis who were operated for typical TN between 1998 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed Four of these showed hyperintense lesions in the pons on T2 MRI sequences. No patient had prior surgery. These four patients underwent different operations for the control of pain but in two of them only ablative procedures were effective DISCUSSION: Although it is uncertain whether the occurrence of TN in our patients may be attributed to the brainstem abnormalities seen on MRI, the presence of these lesions appears to be the most convincing explanation for the occurrence of pain. We believe that, in the presence of such imaging changes, a destructive procedure should be regarded as the elective surgical treatment in patients presenting with typical TN with or without apparent vascular loop compression of the trigeminal root},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

However, VR1 remains the only channel activated by vanilloids such as capsaicin. These channels are excellent molecular candidates to fulfil a range of sensory and/or cellular roles that are well characterized physiologically. Furthermore, as novel pharmacological targets, the vanilloid receptors have potential for the development of many future disease treatments.},

abstract = {The relation between brain structure and function is of fundamental importance in neuroscience. Comparisons between behavioral and brain-imaging measures suggest that variation in brain structure correlates with the presence of specific skills. Behavioral measures, however, reflect the integrated function of multiple brain regions. Rather than behavior, a physiological index of function could be a more sensitive and informative measure with which to compare structural measures. Here, we test for a relationship between a physiological measure of functional connectivity between two brain areas during a simple decision-making task and a measure of structural connectivity. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation indexed functional connectivity between two regions important for action choices: the premotor and motor cortex. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a marker of microstructural integrity, indexed structural connectivity. Individual differences in functional connectivity during action selection show highly specific correlations with FA in localized regions of white-matter interconnecting regions, including the premotor and motor cortex. Probabilistic tractography, a technique for identifying fiber pathways from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), was used to reconstruct the anatomical networks linking the component brain regions involved in making decisions. These findings demonstrate a relationship between individual differences in functional and structural connectivity within human brain networks central to action choice},

abstract = {Cynomolgus monkeys were tested on an associative memory task in which they had to remember object-object pairings. Eight animals (4 unoperated monkeys and 4 monkeys with lesions to components of the 'hippocampal-mammillary' circuit) were trained initially on a conditional object-pair association task that was similar to simple discrimination learning, but which involved presentation of object-pairs instead of single objects. Object-pairs were made up from 4 different objects, each with an identical copy. Animals had to learn which pairings of the 4 objects were rewarded (e.g. AB or CD) and which pairings were not (e.g. AC or BD). Objects appeared as a member of both rewarded and non-rewarded pairs. After several stages of training all monkeys reached a high level of performance making greater than 90{\%} correct choices. In a performance test the monkeys had to discriminate between 3 single objects depending on their past associations with the other objects. Animals had to choose the two objects which in initial training were rewarded as an object pair. Monkeys with the 'hippocampal-mammillary' circuit lesions learned the initial object-pair discriminations at the same rate as control monkeys. In the performance test, however, monkeys with the 'hippocampal-mammillary' circuit lesions performed at chance levels, whereas the control monkeys performed significantly better. The results demonstrate a dissociation between the 'habit' and 'mediational' memory systems for ostensibly the same object-pair associations. They also indicate an important contribution of the 'hippocampal-mammillary' circuit in nonspatial association memory.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized concepts of the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Magnetic resonance imaging provides the ability to delineate the evolution of the disease process over time; captured static snapshots can then be used in pathologic correlations studies. Certain patterns in the 2- or 3-dimensional MRI sphere correlate very well with similarpatterns of histopathology. A multimodality approach that makes use of numerous MRI techniques can lead to significant insights into the nature of the changes in the CNS. MRI-pathology correlation studies in MS are being performed using newer MRI techniques as they become available. Such correlations and basic histopathologic studies have shown abnormalities in MS far beyond the well-documented changes in the plaque and have brought into question the dogma that MS is an initially inflammatory nondegenerative disease. This review briefly outlines technical considerations in MRI-pathology correlativestudies and describes the past and current status of our ability to correlate focal and diffuse changes on the MRI with neuropathologic findings in MS patients},

abstract = {After nerve injury maladaptive changes can occur in injured sensory neurons and along the entire nociceptive pathway within the CNS, which may lead to spontaneous pain or pain hypersensitivity. The resulting neuropathic pain syndromes present as a complex combination of negative and positive symptoms, which vary enormously from individual to individual. This variation depends on a diversity of underlying pathophysiological changes resulting from the convergence of etiological, genotypic, and environmental factors. The pain phenotype can serve therefore, as a window on underlying pathophysiological neural mechanisms and as a guide for developing personalized pain medicine},

@article{Garcia-Larrea2012,
abstract = {To be considered specific for nociception, a cortical region should: (a) have plausible connections with ascending nociceptive pathways; (b) be activated by noxious stimuli; (c) trigger nociceptive sensations if directly stimulated; and (d) tone down nociception when injured. In addition, lesions in this area should have a potential to develop neuropathic pain, as is the case of all lesions in nociceptive pathways. The single cortical region approaching these requirements in humans encompasses the suprasylvian posterior insula and its adjoining medial operculum (referred to as "PIMO" in this review). This region does not contain, however, solely nociceptive networks, but represents in primates the main sensory receiving area of the spinothalamic system, and as such contributes to the processing of thermo-sensory, nociceptive, C-fibre tactile, and visceral input. Nociception (and, a fortiori, pain) should therefore not be considered as a separate sensory modality, like vision or audition, but rather as one component of a global system subtending the most primitive forms of somatosensation. Although a clear functional segregation of PIMO sub-areas has not yet been achieved, some preferential distribution has been described in humans: pain-related networks appear preferentially distributed within the posterior insula, and non-noxious thermal processing in the adjacent medial operculum. Thus, spinothalamic sub-modalities may be partially segregated in the PIMO, in analogy with the separate representation of dorsal column input from joint, muscle spindle and tactile afferents in S1. Specificity, however, may not wholly depend on ascending 'labelled lines' but also on cortical network properties driven by intrinsic and extrinsic circuitry. Given its particular anatomo-functional properties, thalamic connections, and tight relations with limbic and multisensory cortices, the PIMO region deserves to be considered as a third somatosensory region (S3) devoted to the processing of spinothalamic inputs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Previous research has documented various psychosocial risk factors with influence on outcome in low back pain (LBP) patients, but the value of clinical predictors has been less well documented. PURPOSE: To identify clinical and psychosocial risk factors at baseline influencing disability and pain at 1 year in LBP patients sick-listed 3 to 16 weeks, and to look for differences between nonspecific LBP and radiculopathy. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study with 1-year follow-up based on a randomized clinical trial. OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability and change of disability, pain and change in pain at 1 year. METHODS: In a randomized clinical study evaluating multidisciplinary versus brief intervention, 325 patients were followed for 1 year. At baseline, they completed a questionnaire and went through a clinical low back examination, including measure of forward flexion and side flexion as well as tender point examination, a method to estimate diffuse tenderness. Furthermore, degenerative changes on plain X-rays of the lumbar spine were quantified, and sciatica was investigated by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Radiculopathy was verified by magnetic resonance imaging in 111 (34{\%}) patients. At 1 year, questions of disability in daily life activities and pain were answered by 60{\%} and 67{\%}, respectively. The intensity of back+leg pain and disability was closely correlated. Statistically significant predictors for both disability and back+leg pain at 1 year were intensity of back+leg pain, worrying and health anxiety, many tender points, and little or moderate exercise in leisure time. Two additional risk factors were identified in patients with radiculopathy: older age and "drinking alcohol less than once per month." Furthermore, disability at 1 year was associated with initial disability and compensation claim, and back+leg pain at 1 year was associated with fear avoidance about physical activity and the duration of pain. Change in disability was more closely associated with return to work than change in pain. Disc degeneration was not associated with disability or pain at 1 year. General health was not statistically significantly associated with outcome when adjusted for back+leg pain, disability, and worrying and health anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Disability and pain at 1 year were associated with baseline disability and pain, diffuse tenderness, worrying and health anxiety, compensation claim, fear avoidance, and baseline exercise habits. Only in patients with verified nerve root affection, older age, and restrained alcohol seemed to play a role. The multivariate models were insufficient in predicting disability and pain, partly because disability and pain were also strongly associated with return to work},

abstract = {Older adults exhibit global reductions in cortical surface area, but little is known about the regional patterns of reductions or how these relate to other measures of brain structure. This knowledge is critical to understanding the dynamic relationship between different macrostructural properties of the cortex throughout adult life. Here, cortical arealization, local gyrification index (LGI), and cortical thickness were measured vertex wise across the brain surface in 322 healthy adults (20-85 years), with the aims of 1) characterizing age patterns of the three separate cortical measures and 2) testing the age-independent relationships among cortical surface area, gyrification, and thickness. Surface area showed strong age-related decreases, particularly pronounced in dorsomedial prefrontal, lateral temporal, and fusiform cortices, independently of total white matter volume. LGI decreased with age independently of regional surface area, with strongest effects laterally, extending from the angular gyrus in all directions. As expected, regional surface area and LGI were positively related. However, both measures correlated negatively with thickness, indicating increasing local arealization and gyrification with decreasing cortical thickness. We suggest that this pattern of regional "cortical stretching" reflects the well-established phylogenetic principle of maximizing surface area and gyrification rather than increase thickness to facilitate brain connectivity and functional development},

In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we found that placebo analgesia was related to decreased brain activity in pain-sensitive brain regions, including the thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, and was associated with increased activity during anticipation of pain in the prefrontal cortex, providing evidence that placebos alter the experience of pain.},

Changes in CREB function influenced the probability that individual lateral amygdala neurons were recruited into a fear memory trace. Our results suggest a competitive model underlying memory formation, in which eligible neurons are selected to participate in amemorytrace as a function of their relative CREB activity at the time of learning.},

Such behavioral switching can occur either retroactively based on error feedback or proactively by detecting a contextual cue. Recent imaging and electrophysiological data in humans and monkeys support the view that the frontal cortical areas play executive roles in behavioral switching. The anterior cingulate cortex acts retroactively and the pre-supplementary motor area acts proactively to enable behavioral switching. The lateral prefrontal cortex reconfigures cognitive processes constituting the switched behavior. The subthalamic nucleus and the striatum in the basal ganglia mediate these cortical signals to achieve behavioral switching. We discuss how breaking a routine to allow more adaptive behavior requires a fine-tuned recruitment of the frontal cortical-basal ganglia neural network.},

abstract = {Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.},

abstract = {The role of surgery for patients with medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is well established. High-quality magnetic resonance imaging, including gadolinium-enhanced and volume acquisition sequences, should be performed to exclude intracranial tumors or demyelinating disease as the cause of the pain, as well as to clearly demonstrate the trigeminal nerve and adjacent blood vessels. For physiologically healthy patients with Type 1 TN, a microvascular decompression (MVD) is the preferred surgical approach because of its high rate of complete pain relief, the durability of the pain relief, and the fact that trigeminal injury is not required for pain relief. Patients with recurrent TN after a failed MVD, patients with significant medical comorbidities, and patients with multiple sclerosis-related TN are generally recommended to undergo less invasive, destructive surgical techniques aimed at providing pain relief by damaging the trigeminal nerve},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowing the exact location of the optic radiation preoperatively is important for surgery of the temporal lobe. We hypothesized that a greater number of motion-probing gradients (MPGs) would provide better results of diffusion tensor (DT) fiber tractography of the optic radiation. To test this hypothesis, this study evaluated differences in DT fiber tractography of the optic radiation under different MPG settings. METHODS: DT images were obtained in 12 healthy volunteers (7 men, 5 women) with a mean age of 32 years (range, 22-45 years) by using a 3T MR imaging scanner with single-shot echo-planar imaging with parallel acquisition (reduction factor = 2). MPG was applied in 6, 12, 40, and 81 independent directions. The first region of interest (ROI) was placed in the occipital lobe, and the second ROI was placed in the lateral geniculate body. Fibers penetrating both ROIs were considered as the optic radiation. Anteroposterior distance between the tip of the Meyer loop and the lateral geniculate body on an axial section was defined as a loop index. Numbers of fibers and loop indices in both cerebral hemispheres were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: The optic radiation was well visualized in full length by DT fiber tractography in 20 of 24 hemispheres (83{\%}). No significant differences were noted in number of fibers and loop indices among different MPG settings. CONCLUSION: DT fiber tractography can frequently depict almost the entire optic radiation. MPG number does not exert any significant effect on visualization of the optic radiation, and 6-directional MPG is thus sufficient for this purpose},

@article{Love2001,
abstract = {There is now persuasive evidence that trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by demyelination of trigeminal sensory fibres within either the nerve root or, less commonly, the brainstem. In most cases, the trigeminal nerve root demyelination involves the proximal, CNS part of the root and results from compression by an overlying artery or vein. Other causes of trigeminal neuralgia in which demyelination is involved or implicated include multiple sclerosis and, probably, compressive space-occupying masses in the posterior fossa. Examination of trigeminal nerve roots from patients with compression of the nerve root by an overlying blood vessel has revealed focal demyelination in the region of compression, with close apposition of demyelinated axons and an absence of intervening glial processes. Similar foci of nerve root demyelination and juxtaposition of axons have been demonstrated in multiple sclerosis patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Experimental studies indicate that this anatomical arrangement favours the ectopic generation of spontaneous nerve impulses and their ephaptic conduction to adjacent fibres, and that spontaneous nerve activity is likely to be increased by the deformity associated with pulsatile vascular indentation. Decompression of the nerve root produces rapid relief of symptoms in most patients with vessel-associated trigeminal neuralgia, probably because the resulting separation of demyelinated axons and their release from focal distortion reduce the spontaneous generation of impulses and prevent their ephaptic spread. The role of remyelination in initial symptomatic recovery after decompression is unclear. However, remyelination may help to ensure that relief of symptoms is sustained after decompression of the nerve root and may also be responsible for the spontaneous remission of the neuralgia in some patients. In addition to causing symptomatic relief, vascular decompression leads to rapid recovery of nerve conduction across the indented root, a phenomenon that, we suggest, is likely to reflect the reversal of compression-induced conduction block in larger myelinated fibres outside the region of demyelination. Trigeminal neuralgia can occur in association with a range of other syndromes involving vascular compression and hyperactivity of cranial nerves. Clinical observations and electrophysiological studies support the concept that demyelination and ephaptic spread of excitation underlie most, if not all, of these conditions.},

abstract = {As a part of the Papez circuit, the fornix carries information on episodic memory. Several diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have reported on changes in the fornix that occur with aging; however, these studies have been controversial. Using DTI, we attempted to investigate age-related changes of the fornix in the human brain. Sixty subjects (30 males, 30 females; mean age, 49.2 years; range, 20-78 years) were recruited. We categorized subjects into three groups, including young (20-39 years), middle-aged (40-59 years), and older (60-79 years) adults. DTIs were acquired using a sensitivity-encoding head coil on a 1.5 T. We divided the whole fornix into three parts (column, body, and crus) and constructed tractography for each part. We measured fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and tract number for each part of the fornix. In all three parts of the fornix, the FA value and tract number decreased, whereas ADC value increased with aging. In addition, a linear regression model was fitted to all three DTI parameters in each part of the fornix. Degenerative change of the fornix in the human brain appears to have occurred at a near constant rate from the 20s to the30s throughout the lifespan.},

abstract = {Determining biophysical sensitivity and specificity of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging is essential to develop effective imaging metrics of neurodegeneration. Among these metrics, apparent pool size ratio (PSR) from quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging and radial diffusivity (RD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are both known to relate to histological measure of myelin density and integrity. However their relative sensitivities towards quantitative myelin detection are unknown. In this study, we correlated high-resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging measures of subvoxel tissue structures with corresponding quantitative myelin histology in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated animal model of MS. Specifically, we acquired quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics (on the same tissue sample) in an animal model system of type III oligodendrogliopathy which lacked prominent lymphocytic infiltration, a system that had not been previously examined with quantitative MRI. We find that the qMT measured apparent pool size ratio (PSR) showed the strongest correlation with a histological measure of myelin content. DTI measured RD showed the next strongest correlation, and other DTI and relaxation parameters (such as the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1f) or fractional anisotropy (FA)) showed considerably weaker correlations with myelin content. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Pure spatial learning occurs when rats acquire information about an environment while exploring it in the absence of reinforcers. We previously reported that voluntary, unreinforced exploration of a radial maze retards subsequent reinforced conditioned cue preference (CCP) learning in the same maze. In the present experiment, we examined the effects of involuntary, unreinforced pre-exposure to a radial maze. During pre-exposure, rats were moved by an experimenter between the ends of two arms of a radial maze five times in 30 min. This form of pre-exposure retarded CCP learning, whereas rats that were not pre-exposed and rats that were pre-exposed to a maze in a different room displayed normal CCP learning. These findings suggest that some information specific to the maze environment was acquired during involuntary unreinforced pre-exposure to it. In experiment 2, the retardation of reinforced CCP learning by involuntary unreinforced pre-exposure was eliminated by fimbria-fornix lesions made before pre-exposure but was unaffected by fimbria-fornix lesions made after pre-exposure but before training. Large neurotoxic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus made before pre-exposure had no effect on the retardation of CCP learning, but the rats with these lesions were impaired on a standard test of reinforced spatial learning in a water maze. The lesion effects in experiment 2 are similar to those previously reported for voluntary exploration and suggest that pure spatial learning may occur during both voluntary exploration of and involuntary exposure to an environment in the absence of reinforcers. Pure spatial learning can apparently occur with exposure to two different locations within an environment, but the rats do not have to move between the locations voluntarily. An intact fimbria-fornix is required for acquisition but not expression of this form of learning. The hippocampus is not involved in this form of learning.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a dispositional trait involving fear of anxiety-related symptoms. Functional imaging research suggests that the activity of the anterior insular cortex, particularly the right insula, may both mediate AS and play a role in the pathophysiology of phobias. However, no imaging studies have examined whether AS relates to insula morphology. We examined whether AS was significantly correlated with right anterior insula volume and thickness among adults with specific animal phobia (SAP) and healthy comparison (HC) subjects. METHODS: Nineteen adults with SAP and 20 demographically group-matched HC subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. Subjects also completed the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI). Regression and correlation analyses examined ASI scores in relation to anterior and posterior insular cortex volume and thickness within and across subject groups. RESULTS: SAP subjects had significantly higher ASI scores than HC, but did not differ in terms of insula volumes or thickness. ASI scores predicted right anterior insula thickness in SAP but not HC subjects, and right anterior insula volume in the sample as a whole. Correlations of ASI scores with the anterior and posterior insula volume and thickness were not significant in either group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the right anterior insular cortex size is a neural substrate of AS within specific phobia, rather than an independent diagnostic marker of the disorder. Future investigations should examine whether heightened AS represents a shared intermediate phenotype across anxiety disorders, manifesting functionally as increased insular reactivity and clinically as a fear of anxiety symptoms.},

abstract = {The tendency to "catastrophize" during painful stimulation contributes to more intense pain experience and increased emotional distress. Catastrophizing has been broadly conceived as an exaggerated negative "mental set" brought to bear during painful experiences. Although findings have been consistent in showing a relation between catastrophizing and pain, research in this area has proceeded in the relative absence of a guiding theoretical framework. This article reviews the literature on the relation between catastrophizing and pain and examines the relative strengths and limitations of different theoretical models that could be advanced to account for the pattern of available findings. The article evaluates the explanatory power of a schema activation model, an appraisal model, an attention model, and a communal coping model of pain perception. It is suggested that catastrophizing might best be viewed from the perspective of hierarchical levels of analysis, where social factors and social goals may play a role in the development and maintenance of catastrophizing, whereas appraisal-related processes may point to the mechanisms that link catastrophizing to pain experience.

The resulting density on the observations would be a convolution of the SO(3) density with the true S 2 density. Consequently, the methodology, as in the Euclidean case, would be to use Fourier analysis on SO(3) and S 2 , involving rotational and spherical harmonics, respectively. We especially consider the case where the deconvolution operator is a bounded operator lowering the Sobolev order by a finite amount. Consistency results are obtained with rates of convergence calculated under the expected L 2 and Sobolev square norms that are proportionally inverse to some power of the sample size. As an example we introduce the rotational version of the Laplace distribution. * This research was supported in part by ARPA as administered by the AFOSR under contracts AFOSR-90-0292 and DOD F4960-93-1-05...},

abstract = {Individual variation in structural brain network topology has been associated with heritable behavioral phenotypes such as intelligence and schizophrenia, making it a candidate endophenotype. However, little is known about the genetic influences on individual variation in structural brain network topology. Moreover, the extent to which structural brain network topology overlaps with heritability for integrity and volume of white matter remains unknown. In this study, structural network topology was examined using diffusion tensor imaging at 3T. Binary connections between 82 structurally defined brain regions per subject were traced, allowing for estimation of individual topological network properties. Heritability of normalized characteristic path length ($\lambda$), normalized clustering coefficient ($\gamma$), microstructural integrity (FA), and volume of the white matter were estimated using a twin design, including 156 adult twins from the newly acquired U-TWIN cohort. Both $\gamma$ and $\lambda$ were estimated to be under substantial genetic influence. The heritability of $\gamma$ was estimated to be 68{\%}, the heritability estimate for $\lambda$ was estimated to be 57{\%}. Genetic influences on network measures were found to be partly overlapping with volumetric and microstructural properties of white matter, but the largest component of genetic variance was unique to both network traits. Normalized clustering coefficient and normalized characteristic path length are substantially heritable, and influenced by independent genetic factors that are largely unique to network measures, but partly also implicated in white matter directionality and volume. Thus, network measures provide information about genetic influence on brain structure, independent of global white matter characteristics such as volume and microstructural directionality.

In multiple sclerosis (MS) Wallerian degeneration of axons traversing focal lesions is a potential mechanism of damage in normal-appearing white matter. In vivo evidence for this hypothesis is limited. The present study investigated the relationship between DTI-derived indices in the normal-appearing corpus callosum (CC) and the lesion loads (LLs) in connected cerebral regions. DTI was performed in 39 MS patients and in 21 age-matched controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were estimated in the genu, body and splenium of CC. Patients showed lower FA and higher MD in the CC than controls and both correlated with the total LL (r = -0.56 and r = 0.54, p {\textless} 0.0001). The LL of individual cerebral lobes correlated with both FA and MD in the corresponding callosal regions, with the body showing the strongest correlations with frontal and parietal LL (p {\textless} 0.0001). The strong correlations between DTI indices in the CC and the extent of lesions in connected brain regions support the hypothesis that Wallerian degeneration of axons transected by remote, but connected focal lesions, is an important pathogenic mechanism of damage in MS. },

Here we aimed to determine the strength of the evidence for (1) altered activation of S1/M1 during and after pain, (2) the temporal profile of any change in activation and (3) the relationship between S1/M1 activity and the symptoms of pain. In September 2015, five electronic databases were systematically searched for neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies investigating the effect of acute experimental muscle pain on S1/M1 in healthy volunteers. Demographic data, methodological characteristics and primary outcomes for each study were extracted for critical appraisal. Meta-analyses were performed where appropriate. Twenty-five studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. There was consistent evidence from fMRI for increased S1 activation in the contralateral hemisphere during pain, but insufficient evidence to determine the effect at M1. Meta-analyses of TMS and EEG data revealed moderate to strong evidence of reduced S1 and corticomotor excitability during and following the resolution of muscle pain. A comprehensive understanding of the temporal profile of altered activity in S1/M1, and the relationship to symptoms of pain, is hampered by differences in methodological design, pain modality and pain severity between studies. Overall, the findings of this review indicate reduced S1 and corticomotor activity during and after resolution of acute muscle pain, mechanisms that could plausibly underpin altered sensorimotor function in pain. WHAT DOES THIS REVIEW ADD?: We provide the first systematic evaluation of the primary sensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex response to acute experimental muscle pain in healthy volunteers. We present evidence from a range of methodologies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effect of pain on S1/M1. Through meta-analyses we evaluate the strength of evidence concerning the direction and temporal profile of the S1/M1 response to acute muscle pain.},

High spatial and temporal resolution makes the technique very appealing not only for the diagnosis of vascular diseases, but also in basic neuroscience where the aim is to develop a more comprehensive picture of the physiological events accompanying neuronal activation. However, low signal-to-noise ratio and the complexity of flow quantification make ASL one of the more demanding disciplines within MRI. In this review, the theoretical background and main implementations of ASL are revisited. In particular, the perfusion quantification methods, including the problems and pitfalls involved, are thoroughly discussed in this article. Finally, a brief summary of applications is provided.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review. OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the prevalence of facet or zygapophysial joint pain in chronic spinal pain of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar origin by using controlled, comparative local anesthetic blocks and evaluation of false-positive rates of single blocks in the diagnosis of chronic spinal pain of facet joint origin. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Facet or zygapophysial joints are clinically important sources of chronic cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine pain. The previous studies have demonstrated the value and validity of controlled, comparative local anesthetic blocks in the diagnosis of facet joint pain, with a prevalence of 15{\%} to 67{\%} variable in lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions. False-positive rates of single diagnostic blocks also varied from 17{\%} to 63{\%}. METHODS: Five hundred consecutive patients receiving controlled, comparative local anesthetic blocks of medial branches for the diagnosis of facet or zygapophysial joint pain were included. Patients were investigated with diagnostic blocks using 0.5 mL of 1{\%} lidocaine per nerve. Patients with lidocaine-positive results were further studied using 0.5 mL of 0.25{\%} bupivacaine per nerve on a separate occasion. Medial branch blocks were performed with intermittent fluoroscopic visualization, at 2 levels to block a single joint. A positive response was considered as one with at least 80{\%} pain relief from a block of at least 2 hours duration when lidocaine was used, and at least 3 hours or longer than the duration of relief with lidocaine when bupivacaine was used, and also the ability to perform prior painful movements. RESULTS: A total of 438 patients met inclusion criteria. The prevalence of facet joint pain was 39{\%} in the cervical spine [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 32{\%}-45{\%}]; 34{\%} (95{\%} CI, 22{\%}-47{\%}) in the thoracic pain; and 27{\%} (95{\%} CI, 22{\%}-33{\%}) in the lumbar spine. The false-positive rate with a single block in the cervical region was 45{\%}, in the thoracic region was 42{\%}, and in the lumbar region 45{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective review once again confirmed the significant prevalence of facet joint pain in chronic spinal pain.},

abstract = {This paperback edition is a reprint of the 2000 edition. This book provides an overview of the theory and application of linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models in the analysis of grouped data, such as longitudinal data, repeated measures, and multilevel data. A unified model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets from a wide variety of areas, including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. Over 170 figures areincluded in the book. The NLME package for analyzing mixed-effects models in R and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. The balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses. It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find this book appealing for its presentation of novel and efficient computational methods for fitting linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models.

@article{Sivilotti1994,
abstract = {1. Pain hypersensitivity is characterized by an increase in the response to noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia) and a reduction in threshold such that innocuous stimuli begin to elicit pain (allodynia). These sensitivity changes can be produced by an increase in excitability of dorsal horn neurons; the phenomenon of central sensitization. We have now examined whether a reduction in local segmental inhibitory mechanisms produces similar changes. The model system used for studying touch-evoked allodynia has been the recruitment of a low-threshold mechanoreceptor input to the nociceptive flexion withdrawal reflex in the decerebrate-spinal rat. 2. Hamstring flexor alpha motoneurons are characterized by high-threshold cutaneous receptive fields. Mechanical stimuli (pinch or firm pressure) evoke a brisk firing response in these cells, whereas low-intensity stimuli (light touch or brush) produce little or no effect, as expected for the output neurons of the nociceptive flexion withdrawal reflex. 3. Primary afferent C fiber conditioning inputs have previously been shown to produce prolonged increases in the excitability of the flexion reflex, as measured by the augmentation of the response to high-intensity peripheral stimuli. We have now examined whether these conditioning inputs and segmental disinhibition modify the responsiveness of the reflex to low-threshold inputs. 4. Brief (20 s), low-frequency (1 Hz), C fiber conditioning stimuli to the sural nerve increased the response of the hamstring flexor motor neurons to low-intensity cutaneous touch stimuli, reduced the cutaneous mechanical threshold, and increased the response to A beta inputs from the sural nerve. 5. Intrathecal injections of subconvulsant doses of the glycine receptor antagonist, strychnine (7 nmol) or the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (8 nmol) produced similar but longer lasting changes. The GABAB antagonist P-(3-aminopropyl)-P-diethoxymethyl-phosphonic acid (CGP 35348) had no significant effects. 6. The nociceptive flexion withdrawal reflex is under the control, therefore, of segmental inhibitory mechanisms mediated by glycine and GABAA receptors. Removal of this inhibition enables the reflex to be activated by low-intensity cutaneous stimuli. Given the similarities between the stimulus-response profiles of the nociceptive flexion reflex and the production of pain in man, these findings indicate that a decrease in the efficacy of spinal inhibitory circuits may contribute to the touch-evoked allodynia that occurs in pain hypersensitivity states, where A beta inputs begin to produce pain.},

@article{Haufe2014,
abstract = {The increase in spatiotemporal resolution of neuroimaging devices is accompanied by a trend towards more powerful multivariate analysis methods. Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain-computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but complementary objectives require different analysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated a simple imaging sign for Alzheimer's disease (AD), using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We hypothesized that a reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix could be utilized as an imaging sign.

METHODS: Twenty-three patients with AD, 24 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 25 control participants (NC) underwent DTI at baseline and 1 year later. The diagnosis was reevaluated 1 year and 3 years after the initial scan. A color-scaled FA map was used to visually identify the FA reduction ("fornix sign"). We investigated whether the fornix sign could separate AD from NC, and could predict progression from aMCI to AD or NC to aMCI. We also quantified FA of the fornix to validate the fornix sign.

RESULTS: The fornix sign was identical to the lack of any voxels with an FA {\textgreater} .52 within the fornix. The fornix sign differentiated AD from NC with specificity of 1.0 and sensitivity of .56. It predicted conversion from NC to aMCI with specificity of 1.0 and sensitivity of .67, and from aMCI to AD with specificity of .94 and sensitivity of .83.

CONCLUSION: The fornix sign is a promising predictive imaging sign of AD.},

In our preliminary study, we described the feasibility of computed tomography (CT) using an integrated neuronavigation system to cannulate the foramen ovale. METHODS: Analysis was performed on 42 consecutive patients who underwent cannulation of the foramen ovale for radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy guided by CT using an integrated neuronavigation system. The reproducibility and safety of the neuronavigation-guided procedure were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, the average dimension of the foramen ovale was 7.1 (1.5) x 4.7 (1.1) mm, and it was successfully cannulated by neuronavigation guidance in 31 (73.8{\%}) patients with a mean cannulation time of 3.1 (0.7) min and an overall procedure time of 68.2 (16.4) min. The remaining 11 (26.2{\%}) patients required subsequent CT guidance for successful puncture of the foramen ovale. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that neuronavigation-guided cannulation of the foramen ovale can be executed both quickly and safely on an outpatient basis. Additionally, the use of CT with integrated neuronavigation technology provides superior visual-spatial information compared to conventional fluoroscopy, the process of CT scanning, object planning, and neuronavigation-guided intervention can be completed in the same locale, and its application is easy to master and has the potential to enhance procedure tolerability of awake patients},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pathological basis of diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not been elucidated in detail, but may be an important element in disability and clinical progression. METHODS: Fifty-three subjects with MS were examined with T(1), multi-echo T(2) and magnetization transfer (MT). Twenty-three samples of formalin-fixed MS brain tissue were examined with multi-echo T(2) and subsequently stained for myelin phospholipids using luxol fast blue, for axons using Bielschowsky, immunohistochemically for the myelin proteins myelin basic protein (MBP) and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphohydrolase (CNP) and for astrocytes using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Regions of interest in DAWM were compared with normal appearing white matter. RESULTS: Fourteen of 53 subjects with MS in the in vivo study showed the presence of DAWM. Subjects with DAWM were found to have a significantly lower Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and shorter disease duration (DD) when compared with subjects without DAWM (EDSS: 1.5 versus 3.0, p = 0.031; DD: 5.4 versus 10.3 years, p = 0.045). DAWM in vivo had reduced myelin water and MT ratio, and increased T(2) and water content. Histological analysis suggests DAWM, which shows a reduction of the myelin water fraction, is characterized by selective reduction of myelin phospholipids, but with a relative preservation of myelin proteins and axons. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the primary abnormality in DAWM is a reduction or perturbation of myelin phospholipids that correlates with a reduction of the myelin water fraction},

abstract = {Orofacial pain in patients relies on the anatomical pathways conducting nociceptive information, originating from the periphery towards the trigeminal sensory nucleus complex (TSNC) and finally, to the grey matter structures located in the diencephalon and the somatosensorical cortical regions. The anatomy and function of the so-called trigeminothalamic tracts have been investigated before. In these animal-based studies the intracerebral pathways were mapped using different retro- and anterograde tracing methods. We review the literature on the trigeminothalamic tracts. The observations of these studies are related to clinical findings using fMRI trials. The trigeminothalamic tracts can be subdivided into three pathways: a ventral (contralateral) and dorsal (ipsilateral) trigeminothalamic tract and the intranuclear pathway. Based on the reviewed evidence we hypothesize the co-existence of a nociceptive ipsilateral conduction to the cerebral cortex and we translate evidence from animal-based research to the human anatomy. Our hypothesis differs from the current hypothesis that orofacial pain arises only from nociceptive information via the contralateral, ventral trigeminothalamic pathway. Better understanding of the histology, anatomy and connectivity of the trigeminal fibers could contribute to the discovery of a more effective pain treatment in patients suffering from various orofacial pain syndromes},

abstract = {Interactions of pain and cognition have been studied in humans and animals previously, but the relationship between such behavioral interactions and brain activity is unknown. We aimed to show using functional MRI (fMRI) how a cognitively demanding task (Stroop) modulates pain-related brain activations and conversely, how pain modulates attention-related activity. Reaction time data indicated two types of pain responders: subjects in the A group had a faster Stroop reaction time when pain was concomitant to the attention task, while those in the P group had a slower Stroop performance during painful stimulation. fMRI data obtained during Stroop performance with and without noxious stimulation were subjected to region of interest analyses. We first tested whether brain activity during painful median nerve stimulation was modulated by cognitive load. We next tested whether brain activity during the high conflict cognitive task was modulated by pain. Pain-related activity in three regions, primary (S1), and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices, and anterior insula, was attenuated by cognitive engagement, but this effect was specific to the A group. Pain-related activations in the caudal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventroposterior thalamus were not modulated by cognitive load. None of the areas showing attention-related responses, including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices, were modulated by pain. These findings suggest that cortical regions associated with pain can be modulated by cognitive strategies. Furthermore, the distinction of behavioral subgroups may relate to cognitive coping strategies taken by patients with chronic pain},

abstract = {Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience that has defied our understanding for centuries. Through the advent of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, we have been able to examine the human brain and its response to nociceptive inputs. As a result, our knowledge of which brain regions are critical for generating an acute pain experience has grown, as has our understanding of how cognitive, emotional, contextual and various physiological factors influence the pain experience. Furthermore, we have been able to identify key processes within the brain that underpin the transition to and maintenance of chronic pain states, as well as highlight the dramatic consequences of chronic pain on the brain's structure and neurochemistry. Building upon this knowledge, we are now in a position to consider whether any of these brain imaging 'phenotypes' of acute or chronic pain should be considered as useful endophenotypes; thereby enabling us to relate the complex genetics that underpin everyday pain sensitivity or chronic pain states to intermediate biomarkers. This endophenotypic approach-the focus of this Review-simplifies the connection between genes and behavior and is needed for complex disorders like chronic pain.},

abstract = {Rats with conventional lesions of the hippocampus or fornix were compared postoperatively with controls on nonspatial memory tasks. Neither lesion impaired delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) performance in a discrete-trial task involving "pseudo-trial-unique" complex stimuli. An impairment emerged if a single pair of complex stimuli was used throughout each day's session, and the greatest impairment was obtained with the use of a single pair of less complex stimuli throughout each day's test. Transfer to a continuous DMS task with no explicit intertrial interval produced a different pattern because both lesion and control levels of performance were depressed when two complex stimuli were used repeatedly. A final, separate discrimination learning experiment showed that hippocampectomized rats readily discriminated between the stimuli associated with the greatest lesion-induced DMS deficit. Hippocampal dysfunction thus produces clear deficits on non-spatial memory tasks under appropriate test conditions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to create a stereotactic two-dimensional description of the human insula based on accurate radiological morphometric studies. METHODS: Seventy-five normal cerebral MRIs were selected and drawings of the insula then obtained from serial sagittal slices. These drawings were digitalized before superimposing the anterior (AC) and posterior (PC) commissures as references. This allowed us to quantify interindividual anatomical variations in a large cohort of subjects. RESULTS: The morphometric analysis of the insula revealed a more complex shape than previously described. This structure is delimited by four peri-insular sulci (anterior, superior, posterior and inferior) instead of the three sulci classically mentioned. Males have a statistically larger surface area than females, according to a correlated index. Precise measurements of the different insular components allowed us to quantify their potential interindividual anatomical variations and to define their average shapes and stereotactic locations. CONCLUSION: These data create a two-dimensional template of the human insula, with regard to the classical AC-PC stereotactic reference system. They furthermore allow us to quantify the probability that a given element of this structure is located at a predefined position. This should be useful in functional neuroimaging studies and in insular surgery for diagnostic and therapeutic goals.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are associated with a marked disturbance of neural functional connectivity, which may arise from disrupted organization of white matter. The aim of this study was to use constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based tractography to isolate and characterize major intrahemispheric white matter tracts that are important in visuospatial processing. CSD-based tractography avoids a number of critical confounds that are associated with diffusion tensor tractography, and to our knowledge, this is the first time that this advanced diffusion tractography method has been used in autism research. Twenty-five participants with ASD and aged 25, intelligence quotient-matched controls completed a high angular resolution diffusion imaging scan. The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and arcuate fasciculus were isolated using CSD-based tractography. Quantitative diffusion measures of white matter microstructural organization were compared between groups and associated with visuospatial processing performance. Significant alteration of white matter organization was present in the right IFOF in individuals with ASD. In addition, poorer visuospatial processing was associated in individuals with ASD with disrupted white matter in the right IFOF. Using a novel, advanced tractography method to isolate major intrahemispheric white matter tracts in autism, this research has demonstrated that there are significant alterations in the microstructural organization of white matter in the right IFOF in ASD. This alteration was associated with poorer visuospatial processing performance in the ASD group. This study provides an insight into structural brain abnormalities that may influence atypical visuospatial processing in autism.

As a resolution to this difficulty, parallel motor elasticity is used to lower the forces borne by the SEA, enhancing system force bandwidth. To minimize prosthesis cost of transport (COT) and motor or transmission size, we select a parallel stiffness that supplies the necessary ankle stiffness during early stance period dorsiflexion, eliminating the need for SEA during that gait phase. In future investigations, we hope to apply the ankle-foot design to robotic, orthotic, and exoskeletal applications. In the design of biomimetic ankle-foot systems, we feel both series and parallel motor elasticity are of paramount importance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In this volumetric study of the vestibular schwannoma, we evaluated the accuracy and reliability of several approximation methods that are in use, and determined the minimum volume difference that needs to be measured for it to be attributable to an actual difference rather than a retest error. We also found empirical proportionality coefficients for the different methods. DESIGN/SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Methodological study with investigation of three different VS measurement methods compared to a reference method that was based on serial slice volume estimates. These volume estimates were based on: (i) one single diameter, (ii) three orthogonal diameters or (iii) the maximal slice area. Altogether 252 T1-weighted MRI images with gadolinium contrast, from 139 VS patients, were examined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The retest errors, in terms of relative percentages, were determined by undertaking repeated measurements on 63 scans for each method. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to assess the agreement between each of the approximation methods and the reference method. The tendency for approximation methods to systematically overestimate/underestimate different-sized tumours was also assessed, with the help of Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: The most commonly used approximation method, the maximum diameter, was the least reliable measurement method and has inherent weaknesses that need to be considered. This includes greater retest errors than area-based measurements (25{\%} and 15{\%}, respectively), and that it was the only approximation method that could not easily be converted into volumetric units. Area-based measurements can furthermore be more reliable for smaller volume differences than diameter-based measurements. CONCLUSIONS: All our findings suggest that the maximum diameter should not be used as an approximation method. We propose the use of measurement modalities that take into account growth in multiple dimensions instead.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Benign extracerebral lesions such as meningiomas may cause hemiparesis by compression and deviation without infiltrating the white matter. We used magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion tensor tractography to investigate the effects of benign extracerebral lesions on the corticospinal tract (CST). METHODS: Thirteen patients with extracerebral lesions (11 benign meningiomas and 2 benign cysts) underwent magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion tensor tractography of the CST using fiber assignment by continuous tractography. The CST was reconstructed and assessed by comparing the ipsilateral and unaffected contralateral fibers. The tumor volume, relative fractional anisotropy, fiber deviation, relative fiber number, and relative fiber per voxel were compared between patients without and with temporary presurgical hemiparesis. RESULTS: Seven patients without hemiparesis and five patients with temporary hemiparesis were analyzed; one patient had permanent weakness and was excluded from analysis. There was no significant difference in the tumor volume, relative fractional anisotropy, presence of cerebral edema, or CST deviation between groups. In patients with temporary hemiparesis, the median relative fiber number (mean, 0.35 +/- 0.32) and relative fiber per voxel (mean, 0.49 +/- 0.14) were significantly reduced compared with patients without hemiparesis (0.92 +/- 0.55, P = 0.04; and 0.96 +/- 0.28, P {\textless} 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients with benign extracerebral lesions, reduction in fiber number and fiber per voxel, but not fiber deviation, correlated with temporary hemiparesis. Clinical recovery was possible even if the CST fibers detected by diffusion tensor tractography were reduced by benign extracerebral lesions},

(2000). Brodmann's areas 17 and 18 brought into stereotaxic space-where and how variable? Neuroimage, 11(1):66-84]. However, other qualitative reports of V1 location [Smith, G. (1904).

Topographical variation of the human primary cortices: implications for neuroimaging, brain mapping, and neurobiology. Cereb Cortex, 3(4):313-329] suggested a consistent relationship between V1 and the surrounding cortical folds. Here, the relationship between folds and the location of V1 is quantified using surface-based analysis to generate a probabilistic atlas of human V1. High-resolution (about 200 microm) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 T of ex vivo human cerebral hemispheres allowed identification of the full area via the stria of Gennari: a myeloarchitectonic feature specific to V1. Separate, whole-brain scans were acquired using MRI at 1.5 T to allow segmentation and mesh reconstruction of the cortical gray matter. For each individual, V1 was manually identified in the high-resolution volume and projected onto the cortical surface. Surface-based intersubject registration [Fischl, B., Sereno, M.I., Tootell, R.B., and Dale, A.M. (1999b). High-resolution intersubject averaging and a coordinate system for the cortical surface. Hum Brain Mapp, 8(4):272-84] was performed to align the primary cortical folds of individual hemispheres to those of a reference template representing the average folding pattern. An atlas of V1 location was constructed by computing the probability of V1 inclusion for each cortical location in the template space. This probabilistic atlas of V1 exhibits low prediction error compared to previous V1 probabilistic atlases built in volumetric coordinates. The increased predictability observed under surface-based registration suggests that the location of V1 is more accurately predicted by the cortical folds than by the shape of the brain embedded in the volume of the skull. In addition, the high quality of this atlas provides direct evidence that surface-based intersubject registration methods are superior to volume-based methods at superimposing functional areas of cortex and therefore are better suited to support multisubject averaging for functional imaging experiments targeting the cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurovascular contact (NVC) of the trigeminal nerve is not only detected at the affected trigeminal nerve in patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) but is also observed at the asymptomatic nerves on the side contralateral to the TN as well as in normal nerves in control subjects. The frequency and severity of the NVC among the affected, contralateral, and normal trigeminal nerves were analyzed by 3D MR cisternogram and angiogram fusion imaging in relation to the cause of TN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inner view of the fusion MR imaging projected from inside the trigeminal nerve was used. The severity of the NVC was classified as none, simple, moderate, or severe, according to the nerve circumference in contact with the vessel. The NVC was analyzed in the affected nerves (n = 66) and the contralateral nerves (n = 66). Forty patients underwent microvascular decompression surgery, and 26 were treated medically. The NVC at the normal trigeminal nerves (n = 78) was studied in 39 control subjects without symptoms of TN. RESULTS: The NVC in the affected trigeminal nerve was observed more frequently and much more severely than that at the contralateral and normal trigeminal nerves in controls (P {\textless} .01). Additionally, the NVC in the surgical patients was more severe than that in the medically treated patients (P {\textless} .01). CONCLUSIONS: Severity analysis of the NVC with the inner view of the fusion MR imaging may provide useful information in the diagnosis of TN and can be a helpful adjunct in treatment planning for patients with TN},

abstract = {An increasing number of applications use the postnatal piglet model in neuroimaging studies, however, these are based primarily on T1 weighted image templates. There is a growing need for a multimodal structural brain template for a comprehensive depiction of the piglet brain, particularly given the growing applications of diffusion weighted imaging for characterizing tissue microstructures and white matter organization. In this study, we present the first multimodal piglet structural brain template which includes a T1 weighted image with tissue segmentation probability maps, diffusion weighted metric templates with multiple diffusivity maps, and population-based whole-brain fiber tracts for postnatal piglets. These maps provide information about the integrity of white matter that is not available in T1 images alone. The availability of this diffusion weighted metric template will contribute to the structural imaging analysis of the postnatal piglet brain, especially models that are designed for the study of white matter diseases. Furthermore, the population-based whole-brain fiber tracts permit researchers to visualize the white matter connections in the piglet brain across subjects, guiding the delineation of a specific white matter region for structural analysis where current diffusion data is lacking. Researchers are able to augment the tracts by merging tracts from their own data to the population-based fiber tracts and thus improve the confidence of the population-wise fiber distribution.},

abstract = {Despite a wealth of EEG epilepsy data that accumulated for over half a century, our ability to understand brain dynamics associated with epilepsy remains limited. Using EEG data from 15 controls and 9 left temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) patients, in this study we characterize how the dynamics of the healthy brain differ from the "dynamically balanced" state of the brain of epilepsy patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs in the context of resting state. We show that such differences can be observed in band power, synchronization and network measures, as well as deviations from the small world network (SWN) architecture of the healthy brain. The $\theta$ (4-7 Hz) and high $\alpha$ (10-13 Hz) bands showed the biggest deviations from healthy controls across various measures. In particular, patients demonstrated significantly higher power and synchronization than controls in the $\theta$ band, but lower synchronization and power in the high $\alpha$ band. Furthermore, differences between controls and patients in graph theory metrics revealed deviations from a SWN architecture. In the $\theta$ band epilepsy patients showed deviations toward an orderly network, while in the high $\alpha$ band they deviated toward a random network. These findings show that, despite the focal nature of LTLE, the epileptic brain differs in its global network characteristics from the healthy brain. To our knowledge, this is the only study to encompass power, connectivity and graph theory metrics to investigate the reorganization of resting state functional networks in LTLE patients.},

abstract = {This is a revision of guidelines, originally published in 2004, for the assessment of patients with neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system either at peripheral or central level. Screening questionnaires are suitable for identifying potential patients with neuropathic pain, but further validation of them is needed for epidemiological purposes. Clinical examination, including accurate sensory examination, is the basis of neuropathic pain diagnosis. For more accurate sensory profiling, quantitative sensory testing is recommended for selected cases in clinic, including the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathies and for research purposes. Measurement of trigeminal reflexes mediated by A-beta fibers can be used to differentiate symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia from classical trigeminal neuralgia. Measurement of laser-evoked potentials is useful for assessing function of the A-delta fiber pathways in patients with neuropathic pain. Functional brain imaging is not currently useful for individual patients in clinical practice, but is an interesting research tool. Skin biopsy to measure the intraepidermal nerve fiber density should be performed in patients with clinical signs of small fiber dysfunction. The intensity of pain and treatment effect (both in clinic and trials) should be assessed with numerical rating scale or visual analog scale. For future neuropathic pain trials, pain relief scales, patient and clinician global impression of change, the proportion of responders (50{\%} and 30{\%} pain relief), validated neuropathic pain quality measures and assessment of sleep, mood, functional capacity and quality of life are recommended.},

abstract = {Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora are useful for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character {\$}n{\$}-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character {\$}n{\$}-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a mechanism which the neocortex may use to store sequences of patterns. Storing and recalling sequences are necessary for making predictions, recognizing time-based patterns and generating behaviour. Since these tasks are major functions of the neocortex, the ability to store and recall time-based sequences is probably a key attribute of many, if not all, cortical areas. Previously, we have proposed that the neocortex can be modelled as a hierarchy of memory regions, each of which learns and recalls sequences. This paper proposes how each region of neocortex might learn the sequences necessary for this theory. The basis of the proposal is that all the cells in a cortical column share bottom-up receptive field properties, but individual cells in a column learn to represent unique incidences of the bottom-up receptive field property within different sequences. We discuss the proposal, the biological constraints that led to it and some results modelling it.},

These neurons were later optically reactivated during fear conditioning in a different context. The DG experimental group showed increased freezing in the original context, in which a foot shock was never delivered. The recall of this false memory was context-specific, activated similar downstream regions engaged during natural fear memory recall, and was also capable of driving an active fear response. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to generate an internally represented and behaviorally expressed fear memory via artificial means.},

abstract = {Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) is a new technique that, based on high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) MR data, estimates the orientation of multiple intravoxel fiber populations within regions of complex white matter architecture, thereby overcoming the limitations of the widely used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique. One of its main applications is fiber tractography. The noisy nature of diffusion-weighted (DW) images, however, affects the estimated orientations and the resulting fiber trajectories will be subject to uncertainty. The impact of noise can be large, especially for HARDI measurements, which employ relatively high b-values. To quantify the effects of noise on fiber trajectories, probabilistic tractography was introduced, which considers multiple possible pathways emanating from one seed point, taking into account the uncertainty of local fiber orientations. In this work, a probabilistic tractography algorithm is presented based on CSD and the residual bootstrap. CSD, which provides accurate and precise estimates of multiple fiber orientations, is used to extract the local fiber orientations. The residual bootstrap is used to estimate fiber tract probability within a clinical time frame, without prior assumptions about the form of uncertainty in the data. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, the performance of the CSD fiber pathway uncertainty estimator is measured in terms of accuracy and precision. In addition, the performance of the proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art DTI residual bootstrap tractography and to an existing probabilistic CSD tractography algorithm using clinical DW data.},

abstract = {One of the major limitations in the use of genetically modified mice for studying cognitive functions is the lack of regional and temporal control of gene function. To overcome these limitations, a forebrain-specific promoter was combined with the tetracycline transactivator system to achieve both regional and temporal control of transgene expression. Expression of an activated calcium-independent form of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) resulted in a loss of hippocampal long-term potentiation in response to 10-hertz stimulation and a deficit in spatial memory, a form of explicit memory. Suppression of transgene expression reversed both the physiological and the memory deficit. When the transgene was expressed at high levels in the lateral amygdala and the striatum but not other forebrain structures, there was a deficit in fear conditioning, an implicit memory task, that also was reversible. Thus, the CaMKII signaling pathway is critical for both explicit and implicit memory storage, in a manner that is independent of its potential role in development.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We attempted to assess the feasibility of a 1.6-mm isotropic voxel diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography at 3T in visualizing nerve bundles in the limbic system. METHODS: We examined 20 healthy volunteers by conventional DTI with a voxel size of 1.6 x 1.6 x 3.0 mm and by high-resolution DTI with a voxel size of 1.6 x 1.6 x 1.6 mm and generated tractographs of three limbic nerve bundles: the fornix, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus. We visually assessed whether these bundles reached their targets and compared their diffusion parameters between the two techniques. RESULTS: The entire pathways of the fornix, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus were more readily visualized by high-resolution DTI than by conventional DTI. Among these, the fimbria of the fornix and the uncinate fasciculus adjacent to the temporal pole were identified more frequently by high-resolution DTI (visualization rate 83 and 100{\%}, respectively) than by conventional DTI (visualization rate 63 and 83{\%}, respectively) at a statistical significance of P {\textless} 0.05 and P {\textless} 0.01, respectively). Fractional anisotropy values in the fornix, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus by high-resolution DTI were significantly higher than those by conventional DTI (P {\textless} 0.01); in contrast, the apparent diffusion coefficient values of all these fibers except that of the fornix remained unchanged between the two techniques. CONCLUSION: The 1.6-mm istropic voxel DTI at 3T is a feasible visualization tool and can improve the precision of tracking nerve bundles of the limbic system.},

abstract = {Trigeminal neuralgia is a recurrent severe shooting neuropathic pain which can be managed both pharmacologically and surgically. However, there are no prospective data that compare these two therapeutic strategies. This study therefore aimed to assess long-term outcome in patients with intractable trigeminal neuralgia treated with oxcarbazepine and later with surgery. Fifteen patients (11 females) with trigeminal neuralgia intractable to available drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin and baclofen), were prospectively followed for 13 years (1986-1999) with a total follow up time from onset of disease of 16 +/- 6 years (mean +/- SD), range 8-30 years. All patients were contacted in 1999 and 12 replied, two had died and one had last replied in 1996. Patients were first treated with oxcarbazepine 1200 +/- 600 mg daily dosage (mean +/- SD) and subsequently with surgery of their choice. The outcome measures used were: McGill Pain Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, patient satisfaction questionnaire and clinicians' global evaluation. Pain control was initially achieved in all patients and oxcarbazepine was used continuously or intermittently for 4.0 +/- 3 years (mean +/- SD). Thirteen patients experienced some mild side effects and a dose-dependent hyponatraemia was noted. Subsequently, 12 patients required surgery (five microvascular decompressions and seven surgery at the level of the Gasserian ganglion) to control their pain and were followed up for 4.3 +/- 1.7 years post surgery (mean +/- SD). Three patients required repeat surgery to control their pain, which was successful in two. A further two patients continued with low dose medication post initially successful surgery. Three patients reported numbness and one hearing loss after surgery. Kaplan Meier analysis 3 years after oxcarbazepine use and then 3 years after surgery showed that the mean time for recurrence of pain after oxcarbazepine treatment was 10 months whilst for surgery it was 28 months (P{\textless}0.0001). Pain free periods and types of complications post surgery varied and depended on the type of surgery performed. Due to the small numbers, it was not possible to analyse the different types of surgical procedures individually. Outcomes after any type of surgery were better on all evaluations and eight patients felt that they should have had surgery earlier. Oxcarbazepine is a potent antineuralgic drug with very good acceptability and tolerability. However, its effectiveness was rather short term necessitating surgical intervention. As surgery was associated with better outcome, patients may therefore benefit from having surgery earlier rather than later in the disease process in order to improve quality of life, freedom from medication and the need for regular follow up. Surgery does not provide pain relief for all patients. This is the first study that has compared outcome in a group of patients who have had both pharmacological and surgical treatments. As these data cannot be extrapolated to other antineuralgic drugs, similar comparative studies would be appropriate},

abstract = {The gate control theory's most important contribution to understanding pain was its emphasis on central neural mechanisms. The theory forced the medical and biological sciences to accept the brain as an active system that filters, selects and modulates inputs. The dorsal horns, too, were not merely passive transmission stations but sites at which dynamic activities (inhibition, excitation and modulation) occurred. The great challenge ahead of us is to understand brain function. I have therefore proposed that the brain possesses a neural network--the body-self neuromatrix--which integrates multiple inputs to produce the output pattern that evokes pain. The body-self neuromatrix comprises a widely distributed neural network that includes parallel somatosensory, limbic and thalamocortical components that subserve the sensory-discriminative. affective-motivational and evaluative-cognitive dimensions of pain experience. The synaptic architecture of the neuromatrix is determined by genetic and sensory influences. The 'neurosignature' output of the neuromatrix--patterns of nerve impulses of varying temporal and spatial dimensions--is produced by neural programs genetically build into the neuromatrix and determines the particular qualities and other properties of the pain experience and behavior. Multiple inputs that act on the neuromatrix programs and contribute to the output neurosignature include. (1) sensory inputs (cutaneous, visceral and other somatic receptors); (2) visual and other sensory inputs that influence the cognitive interpretation of the situation; (3) phasic and tonic cognitive and emotional inputs from other areas of the brain; (4) intrinsic neural inhibitory modulation inherent in all brain function; (5) the activity of the body's stress-regulation systems, including cytokines as well as the endocrine, autonomic, immune and opioid systems. We have traveled a long way from the psychophysical concept that seeks a simple one-to-one relationship between injury and pain. We now have a theoretical framework in which a genetically determined template for the body-self is modulated by the powerful stress system and the cognitive functions of the brain, in addition to the traditional sensory inputs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) quantifies the motion of water within brain tissue. Inflammation leads to tissue disruption, resulting in increased diffusivity and decreased directionality. We aimed to quantify the damage within tumefactive giant brain lesions (TGL) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using MRI and DTI methodology. METHODS: Region of interest were determined on TGL and acute MS lesions to obtain metrics such as volume, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity ((||) ), and radial diffusivity ((⊥) ). RESULTS: We identified 10 TGL in 10 patients with MS. The incidence of TGL was 2.8{\%}. Comparing TGL to acute 16 MS lesions, DTI metrics demonstrated significantly higher ADC, (||) and (⊥) diffusivities and lower FA values in TGL (P {\textless}.001). Five TGL were reevaluated after 120 days by MRI and DTI metrics. Significant group changes were detected at 120 days: TGL volume decreased, ADC, (||) and (⊥) values were lower and FA was higher (P {\textless} .01). CONCLUSIONS: Within the spectrum of acute MS lesions, TGL present DTI metrics of an intense acute inflammatory process. Analysis of TGL progression proposes that DTI metrics sensitively detects micro-structural changes in TGL from acute inflammation towards lesion recovery and reorganization.

abstract = {MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain and spine provides a unique tool for both visualizing directionality and assessing intactness of white matter fiber tracts in vivo. At the spatial resolution of clinical MRI, much of primate white matter is composed of interdigitating fibers. Analyses based on an assumed single diffusion tensor per voxel yield important information about the average diffusion in the voxel but fail to reveal structure in the presence of crossing tracts. Until today, all clinical scans assume only one tensor, causing potential serious errors in tractography. Since high angular resolution imaging remains, so far, untenable for routine clinical use, a method is proposed whereby the single-tensor field is augmented with additional information gleaned from standard clinical DTI. The method effectively resolves two distinct tract directions within voxels, in which only two tracts are assumed to exist. The underlying constrained two-tensor model is fitted in two stages, utilizing the information present in the single-tensor fit. As a result, the necessary MRI time can be drastically reduced when compared with other approaches, enabling widespread clinical use. Upon evaluation in simulations and application to in vivo human brain DTI data, the method appears to be robust and practical and, if correctly applied, could elucidate tract directions at critical points of uncertainty.},

But for each problem, getting a deep model to work well involves research into the architecture and a long period of tuning. We present a single model that yields good results on a number of problems spanning multiple domains. In particular, this single model is trained concurrently on ImageNet, multiple translation tasks, image captioning (COCO dataset), a speech recognition corpus, and an English parsing task. Our model architecture incorporates building blocks from multiple domains. It contains convolutional layers, an attention mechanism, and sparsely-gated layers. Each of these computational blocks is crucial for a subset of the tasks we train on. Interestingly, even if a block is not crucial for a task, we observe that adding it never hurts performance and in most cases improves it on all tasks. We also show that tasks with less data benefit largely from joint training with other tasks, while performance on large tasks degrades only slightly if at all.},

Pathological assessment is the gold standard for such identification, but has intrinsic limitations owing to the limited availability of autopsy and biopsy tissue. MRI has gained a leading role in the assessment of MS because it allows doctors to obtain an ante mortem picture of the degree of CNS involvement. A number of correlative pathological and MRI studies have helped to define in vivo the pathological substrates of MS in focal lesions and normal-appearing white matter, not only in the brain, but also in the spinal cord. These studies have resulted in the identification of aspects of pathophysiology that were previously neglected, including grey matter involvement and vascular pathology. Despite these important achievements, numerous open questions still need to be addressed to resolve controversies about how the pathology of MS results in fixed neurological disability.},

Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, e.g. they can be taken from a segmentation tree, or from any family of over-segmentations. The system yields record accuracies on the Sift Flow Dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona Dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on Stanford Background Dataset (8 classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a 320×240 image labeling in less than a second, including feature extraction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) continue to be subjects of debate, with varying opinions regarding the extent to which tissue-based impairments versus the impacts of other stressors cause ongoing disability. Detecting areas of the brain with abnormalities that can explain symptoms and behavior in patients with MTBI is important in order to confirm the diagnosis of MTBI. METHODS: In this study, we calculated diffusion maps from results of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) performed in an apparently healthy control group. We then compared these maps with those of patients with MTBI (MTBI group) or diffuse axonal injury (DAI group). All diffusion maps were normalized to the International Consortium for Brain Mapping atlas for atlas-based analysis and were segmented and normalized by the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie tool in SPM8 to reduce misregistration. RESULTS: All diffusion measures in the DAI group were lower than in the control group. There were significant differences in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, fornix and right cerebral peduncle in the DAI group compared with the control group (P{\textless}.001). The MTBI group had higher axial diffusivity than the control group in the right corticospinal tract, left medial lemniscus, left inferior cerebellar peduncle, bilateral anterior limb of the internal capsule, right anterior corona radiata, bilateral cingulum (cingulate gyrus) and left superior frontooccipital fasciculus (P{\textless}.05). CONCLUSIONS: Voxel- and atlas-based analysis of DTI might suggest that patients with MTBI have focal axonal injury and that the pathophysiology is significantly different from that of DAI. These findings will help in the diagnosis of patients with MTBI.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can provide information related to the arrangement of white matter fibers. The diffusion tensor is the model most commonly used to derive the orientation of the fibers within a voxel. However, this model has been shown to fail in regions containing several fiber populations with distinct orientations. A number of alternative models have been suggested, such as multiple tensor fitting, q-space, and Q-ball imaging. However, each of these has inherent limitations. In this study, we propose a novel method for estimating the fiber orientation distribution directly from high angular resolution diffusion-weighted MR data without the need for prior assumptions regarding the number of fiber populations present. We assume that all white matter fiber bundles in the brain share identical diffusion characteristics, thus implicitly assigning any differences in diffusion anisotropy to partial volume effects. The diffusion-weighted signal attenuation measured over the surface of a sphere can then be expressed as the convolution over the sphere of a response function (the diffusion-weighted attenuation profile for a typical fiber bundle) with the fiber orientation density function (ODF). The fiber ODF (the distribution of fiber orientations within the voxel) can therefore be obtained using spherical deconvolution. The properties of the technique are demonstrated using simulations and on data acquired from a volunteer using a standard 1.5-T clinical scanner. The technique can recover the fiber ODF in regions of multiple fiber crossing and holds promise for applications such as tractography.},

We then apply the identical probabilistic algorithm to tractography in the multi- and single-fibre cases in a number of example systems which have previously been tracked successfully or unsuccessfully with single-fibre tractography. We show that multi-fibre tractography offers significant advantages in sensitivity when tracking non-dominant fibre populations, but does not dramatically change tractography results for the dominant pathways.},

abstract = {We address the problem of applying spatial transformations (or "image warps") to diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images. The orientational information that these images contain must be handled appropriately when they are transformed spatially during image registration. We present solutions for global transformations of three-dimensional images up to 12-parameter affine complexity and indicate how our methods can be extended for higher order transformations. Several approaches are presented and tested using synthetic data. One method, the preservation of principal direction algorithm, which takes into account shearing, stretching and rigid rotation, is shown to be the most effective. Additional registration experiments are performed on human brain data obtained from a single subject, whose head was imaged in three different orientations within the scanner. All of our methods improve the consistency between registered and target images over naive warping algorithms.},

However, the effectiveness of word embeddings for downstream NLP tasks is limited by out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, for which embeddings do not exist. In this paper, we present MIMICK, an approach to generating OOV word embeddings compositionally, by learning a function from spellings to distributional embeddings. Unlike prior work, MIMICK does not require re-training on the original word embedding corpus; instead, learning is performed at the type level. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations demonstrate the power of this simple approach. On 23 languages, MIMICK improves performance over a word-based baseline for tagging part-of-speech and morphosyntactic attributes. It is competitive with (and complementary to) a supervised character-based model in low-resource settings.},

abstract = {Cortical plasticity is thought to occur following continuous barrage of nociceptive afferent signals to the brain. Hence, chronic pain is presumed to induce anatomical and physiological changes in the brain over time. Inherent factors, some pre-dating the onset of chronic pain, may also contribute to brain abnormalities present in patients. In this study we used structural MRI to examine whether patients with chronic temporomandibular (TMD) pain have abnormalities in gray matter (GM) within brain areas implicated in pain, modulation and sensorimotor function. We found that patients with TMD have cortical thickening in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), frontal polar and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). These findings provide a structural basis for previous findings of TMD pain and cognitive sluggishness in TMD. We then examined the contribution of TMD characteristics to GM abnormalities. We found that 1) GM in the sensory thalamus positively correlated to TMD duration, 2) cortical thickness in the primary motor (M1) and the anterior mid-cingulate cortices (aMCC) were negatively correlated to pain intensity, and 3) pain unpleasantness was negatively correlated to cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These findings suggest that an individual's TMD pain history contributes to GM in the brain. Lastly, we examined the contribution of a potential pre-existing vulnerability due to neuroticism. In the TMD patients, we found that there was an abnormal positive correlation between neuroticism and OFC thickness, in contrast to the negative correlation found in the healthy controls. Therefore, neuroticism may contribute to TMD pathophysiology. In sum, our data suggest that GM in the brain of patients with chronic TMD pain can be shaped by both personality and pain characteristics.},

For longer documents and summaries however these models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases. We introduce a neural network model with a novel intra-attention that attends over the input and continuously generated output separately, and a new training method that combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL). Models trained only with supervised learning often exhibit "exposure bias" - they assume ground truth is provided at each step during training. However, when standard word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the resulting summaries become more readable. We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets. Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, an improvement over previous state-of-the-art models. Human evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries.},

@article{Sindou2007,
abstract = {OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of microvascular decompression (MVD) and to identify the factors affecting outcome in patients treated for primary trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Only the cases with a clear-cut neurovascular conflict (vascular contact and/or compression of the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve) found at surgery and treated with "pure" MVD (decompression of the root without any additional lesioning or cutting of the adjacent rootlets) were retained. METHODS: The study included 362 patients who were followed up over a period of 1 to 18 years (median follow-up 7.2 years). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was generated at 1 and 15 years of follow-up for all of the considered factors. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the success rate (defined as pain-free patients without any medication) was 91{\%} at 1 year and estimated to be 73.38{\%} after 15 years of follow-up. RESULTS: None of the following patient-related factors played any significant role in prognosis: sex, patient age at surgery, history of systemic hypertension, duration of neuralgia before surgery, or history of failed trigeminal surgery. Patients with atypical neuralgia (a baseline of permanent pain) had the same outcome as those with a typical (purely spasmodic) presentation. In addition, the side and topography of the trigeminal nerve did not play a role, whereas involvement of all three divisions of the nerve had a negative effect on outcome. Concerning anatomical factors, neither the type of the compressive vessel nor its location along or around the root was found to be significant. However, the severity of compression was important-the more severe the degree of compression, the better the outcome (p = 0.002). The authors also found that presence of focal arachnoiditis had a negative influence on outcome (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Pure MVD can offer patients affected by a primary TN a 73.38{\%} probability of long-term (15 years) cure of neuralgia. The presence of a clear-cut and marked vascular compression at surgery (and possibly-although not yet reliably--on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging) is the guarantee of a higher than 90{\%} success rate.},

abstract = {The insular cortex of macaques has a wide spectrum of anatomical connections whose distribution is related to its heterogeneous cytoarchitecture. Although there is evidence of a similar cytoarchitectural arrangement in humans, the anatomical connectivity of the insula in the human brain has not yet been investigated in vivo. In the present work, we used in vivo probabilistic white-matter tractography and Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) to study the variation of connectivity patterns across insular territories in humans. In each subject and hemisphere, we recovered a rostrocaudal trajectory of connectivity variation ranging from the anterior dorsal and ventral insula to the dorsal caudal part of the long insular gyri. LE suggested that regional transitions among tractography patterns in the insula occur more gradually than in other brain regions. In particular, the change in tractography patterns was more gradual in the insula than in the medial premotor region, where a sharp transition between different tractography patterns was found. The recovered trajectory of connectivity variation in the insula suggests a relation between connectivity and cytoarchitecture in humans resembling that previously found in macaques: tractography seeds from the anterior insula were mainly found in limbic and paralimbic regions and in anterior parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, while seeds from caudal insular territories mostly reached parietal and posterior temporal cortices. Regions in the putative dysgranular insula displayed more heterogeneous connectivity patterns, with regional differences related to the proximity with either putative granular or agranular regions},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: White matter diffusivity measures of the fornix change with aging, which likely relates to changes in memory and cognition in older adults. Subregional variations in forniceal diffusivity may exist, given its heterogeneous anatomy and connectivity; however, these have not been closely examined in vivo. We examined diffusivity parameters (fractional anisotropy, FA; radial diffusivity, RD; axial diffusivity, AD) in forniceal subregions of healthy subjects and correlated them with age and hippocampal volume. METHODS: Diffusion-weighted imaging and streamline tractography of the fornix were performed on 20 healthy, right-handed females (23-66 years). Six anatomical subregions were defined: midline (body, column, precommissural fornix) or lateral (fimbria, crura, postcommissural fornix). Regression analysis was performed comparing diffusivities against age. Hippocampal and ventricular volumes were also compared. RESULTS: Diffusivity values revealed statistical changes with age in both midline and lateralized subregions. The fornix body and left crus showed age-related alterations in all metrics (FA, RD, AD), whereas only right crus FA was altered. There was no significant change in hippocampal volumes, suggesting that forniceal changes may precede hippocampal age-related changes. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related changes in fornix diffusivity measures appear subregion dependent and asymmetrical. Specific subregion diffusivity measures may be a more sensitive aging marker than hippocampal volume change. {\textcopyright} 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

For example, these advances have revealed the association between white matter damage and vascular disease as well as their impact on risk for and development of dementia and depression in an aging population. Current neuroimaging methods to quantify white matter damage provide a foundation for understanding such age-related neuropathology; however, these methods are not as adept at determining the underlying microstructural abnormalities signaling at risk tissue or driving white matter damage in the aging brain. This review will begin with a brief overview of the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in understanding white matter alterations in aging before focusing in more detail on select advances in both diffusion-based methods and multi-component relaxometry techniques for imaging white matter microstructural integrity within myelin sheaths and the axons they encase. Although DTI greatly extended the field of white matter interrogation, these more recent technological advances will add clarity to the underlying microstructural mechanisms that contribute to white matter damage. More specifically, the methods highlighted in this review may prove more sensitive (and specific) for determining the contribution of myelin versus axonal integrity to the aging of white matter in brain.},

A system of inferences of this kind is properly viewed as a theory because such states are not directly observable, and the system can be used to make predictions about the behavior of others. As to the mental states the chimpanzee may infer, consider those inferred by our own species, for example, purpose or intention, as well as knowledge, belief, thinking, doubt, guessing, pretending, liking, and so forth. To determine whether or not the chimpanzee infers states of this kind, we showed an adult chimpanzee a series of videotaped scenes of a human actor struggling with a variety of problems. Some problems were simple, involving inaccessible food - bananas vertically or horizontally out of reach, behind a box, and so forth - as in the original Kohler problems; others were more complex, involving an actor unable to extricate himself from a locked cage, shivering because of a malfunctioning heater, or unable to play a phonograph because it was unplugged. With each videotape the chimpanzee was given several photographs, one a solution to the problem, such as a stick for the inaccessible bananas, a key for the locked up actor, a lit wick for the malfunctioning heater. The chimpanzee's consistent choice of the correct photographs can be understood by assuming that the animal recognized the videotape as representing a problem, understood the actor's purpose, and chose alternatives compatible with that purpose.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of intraoperative neuronavigation for accessing skull base foramina and, specifically, cannulating of the foramen ovale during percutaneous rhizotomy procedures using an intraoperative image guidance CT scanner (Medtronic O-arm, Littleton, Massachusetts). METHODS: A noninvasive Landmark Fess Strap attached to a spine reference frame was applied to the heads of 4 patients who harbored a difficult-to-access foramen ovale. An intraoperative HD3D skull base scan using a Medtronic O-arm was obtained, and Synergy Spine software was used to create 3D reconstructions of the skull base. Using image guidance, we navigated the needle to percutaneously access the foramen ovale by the use of a single tract for successful completion of balloon compression of the trigeminal nerve.

abstract = {To what extent do we share feelings with others? Neuroimaging investigations of the neural mechanisms involved in the perception of pain in others may cast light on one basic component of human empathy, the interpersonal sharing of affect. In this fMRI study, participants were shown a series of still photographs of hands and feet in situations that are likely to cause pain, and a matched set of control photographs without any painful events. They were asked to assess on-line the level of pain experienced by the person in the photographs. The results demonstrated that perceiving and assessing painful situations in others was associated with significant bilateral changes in activity in several regions notably, the anterior cingulate, the anterior insula, the cerebellum, and to a lesser extent the thalamus. These regions are known to play a significant role in pain processing. Finally, the activity in the anterior cingulate was strongly correlated with the participants' ratings of the others' pain, suggesting that the activity of this brain region is modulated according to subjects' reactivity to the pain of others. Our findings suggest that there is a partial cerebral commonality between perceiving pain in another individual and experiencing it oneself. This study adds to our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in intersubjectivity and human empathy.},

As visualization inherently involves the capabilities from computer graphics, image processing, volume rendering, computational geometry, human/computer interaction, and other fields, VTK supports these capabilities in an integrated, robust manner. VTK is packaged as a part of a sophisticated development environment that includes advanced interface, build, and test tool. It is this combination of openness, extensive features, reliability, and comprehensive development environment that makes VTK one of today's premier visualization tools for academic, research, and commercial applications. This chapter provides insight into the key features of the toolkit. The focus is on architecture and system concepts. The chapter also provides the motivation, history, and goals for VTK. Further, it describes important architectural features and how VTK is used in large-data visualization, one of the key challenges facing visualization systems of the future. The chapter concludes with a brief survey of important applications developed using VTK. {\textcopyright} 2005 Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The aim of this study was to analyze 1 surgeon's 4-year experience with microvascular decompression ([MVD], 36 patients) and Gamma Knife surgery ([GKS], 44 patients) in 80 consecutive patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective cohort study from March 1999 to December 2003 with an independent clinical assessment of the results and serial patient satisfaction surveys. All patients completed a 2004 patient satisfaction survey (0.5-5 years postoperative), and 70{\%} of surviving patients completed the same survey in 2007 (3.9-8.5 years postoperative). Follow-up was undertaken in 100{\%} of the patients (mean 3.4 +/- 2.14 years, range 0.17-8.5 years). RESULTS: Respective initial and latest follow-up raw pain-free rates were 100 and 80.6{\%} for MVD and 77.3 and 45.5{\%} for GKS. The median time to the maximal benefit after GKS was 4 weeks (range 1 week-6 months). Respective initial, 2-, and 5-year actuarial pain-free rates were 100, 88, and 80{\%} for MVD and 78, 50, and 33{\%} for GKS (p = 0.0002). The relative risk of losing a pain-free status by 5 years posttreatment was 3.35 for patients in the GKS group compared with the MVD group. Initial and 5-year actuarial rates for {\textgreater}or= 50{\%} pain relief after GKS were 100 and 80{\%}, respectively. The respective rates of permanent mild and severe sensory loss were 5.6 and 0{\%} for patients in the MVD group, as opposed to 6.8 and 2.3{\%} for patients in the GKS group. Anesthesia dolorosa did not occur during the study. Both procedures enjoyed a high degree of early patient satisfaction (95-100{\%}). Microvascular decompression maintained the same rate of patient satisfaction, but satisfaction with GKS decreased to 75{\%} as pain control waned. Twenty-three patients (29{\%}) died of causes unrelated to the TN or the surgical intervention during the follow-up, and their pain status was known at the time of death. Statistically significant intergroup differences for the MVD versus GKS cohorts were age (median 54 years, range 36-70 years vs median 74 years, range 48-92 years, respectively), preoperative symptom duration (median 2.58 years, range 0.33-15 years vs median 7.5, range 0.6-40 years, respectively), and the presence of major comorbidities (2.8 vs 58.3{\%}, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this nonrandomized prospective cohort trial of selected patients with potentially relevant intergroup differences, MVD was significantly superior to GKS in achieving and maintaining a pain-free status in those with TN and provided similar early and superior longer-term patient satisfaction rates compared with those for GKS. The complications of wound cerebrospinal fluid leakage, hearing loss, and persistent diplopia (1 case each in the MVD group) were not seen after GKS},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a comparative study to analyze dosimetry and results to understand the significant difference in the rate of trigeminal dysfunction after gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia between two centers using the same target. METHODS: The data of 358 patients (109 patients from Brussels and 259 patients from Marseilles) were analyzed. Three different dosimetric strategies were found: treatment with less than 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 1; patients from Marseilles only), treatment with 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 2; patients from Brussels and Marseilles), or treatment with 90 Gy and use of selective beam channel blocking (Group 3; patients from Brussels only). RESULTS: The prescription dose and the use of selective beam channel blocking have been significantly associated with a higher energy received by the retrogasserian trigeminal nerve root. The different radiation dose delivered to the nerve root in these three groups of patients was significantly associated with the incidence of mild (15, 21, and 49{\%} for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and bothersome (1.4, 2.4, and 10{\%} for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) trigeminal dysfunction. The good and excellent rates of pain relief were 81 and 66{\%}, respectively, for Group 1, 85 and 77{\%}, respectively, for Group 2, and 90 and 84{\%}, respectively, for Group 3, and were also related to the amount of energy received by nerve root volume. CONCLUSION: Using a similar target, the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction and the pain relief rate can vary according to the radiation energy received by the retrogasserian part of the trigeminal nerve root. The prescription dose and the use of beam channel blocking modify the integrated dose delivered to the nerve and may contribute to the different rates of trigeminal numbness and pain outcome. The radiobiological effect of gamma knife radiosurgery may be related to the energy delivered to nerve root volume, rather than to the maximal dose delivered},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is characterized morphologically by the key features demyelination, inflammation, gliosis and axonal damage. In recent years, it has become more evident that axonal damage is the major morphological substrate of permanent clinical disability. In our study, we investigated the occurrence of acute axonal damage determined by immunocytochemistry for amyloid precursor protein (APP) which is produced in neurones and accumulates at sites of recent axon transection or damage. The numbers of APP-positive axons in multiple sclerosis lesions were correlated with the disease duration and course. Most APP-positive axons were detected within the first year after disease onset, but acute axonal damage was also detected to a minor degree in lesions of patients with a disease duration of 10 years and more. This effect was not due to the lack of active demyelinating lesions in the chronic disease stage. Late remyelinated lesions (so-called shadow plaques) did not show signs of axon destruction. The number of inflammatory cells showed a decrease over time similar to that of the number of APP-positive axons. There was a significant correlation between the extent of axon damage and the numbers of CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells and macrophages/microglia. Our results indicate that a putative axon-protective treatment should start as early as possible and include strategies preventing T cell/macrophage-mediated axon destruction and leading to remyelination of axons.},

abstract = {Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying assumptions. Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

This makes exhaustive hyperparameter search, as is commonly done with other neural network architectures, prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present the first large-scale analysis of NMT architecture hyperparameters. We report empirical results and variance numbers for several hundred experimental runs, corresponding to over 250,000 GPU hours on the standard WMT English to German translation task. Our experiments lead to novel insights and practical advice for building and extending NMT architectures. As part of this contribution, we release an open-source NMT framework that enables researchers to easily experiment with novel techniques and reproduce state of the art results.},

In these ten years, connections have been described between the insula and the orbital cortex, frontal operculum, lateral premotor cortex, ventral granular cortex, and medial area 6 in the frontal lobe. Insular connections between the second somatosensory area and retroinsular area of the parietal lobe have been documented. The insula was found to connect with the temporal pole and the superior temporal sulcus of the temporal lobe. It has an abundance of local intrainsular connections and projections to subdivisions of the cingulate gyrus. The insula has connections with the lateral, lateral basal, central, cortical and medial amygdaloid nuclei. It also connects with nonamygdaloid areas such as the perirhinal cortex, entorhinal, and periamygdaloid cortex. The thalamic taste area, the parvicellular part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus, projects fibers to the ipsilateral insular-opercular cortex. In the past decade, confirmation has been given to the insula as a visceral sensory area, visceral motor area, motor association area, vestibular area, and language area. Recent studies have expanded the role of the insula as a somatosensory area, emphasizing its multifaceted, sensory role. The idea of the insula as limbic integration cortex has been affirmed and its role in Alzheimer's disease suggested.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate microstructural tissue changes of trigeminal nerve (TGN) in patients with unilateral trigeminal neuralgia (TN) by multiple diffusion metrics, and correlate the diffusion indexes with the clinical variables. METHODS: 16 patients with TN and 6 healthy controls (HC) were recruited into our study. All participants were imaged with a 3.0T system with three-dimension time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) DTI-sequence. We placed regions of interest over the root entry zone of the TGN and measured fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). The mean values of FA, MD, AD and RD were compared between the affected and unaffected sides in the same patient, and to HC values. The correlation between the side-to-side diffusion metric difference and clinical variables (disease duration and visual analogy scale, VAS) was further explored. RESULTS: Compared with the unaffected side and HC, the affected side showed significantly decreased FA and increased RD; however, no significant changes of AD were found. A trend toward significantly increased MD was identified on the affected side comparing with the unaffected side. We also found the significant correlation between the FA reduction and VAS of pain (r=-0.55, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: DTI can quantitatively assess the microstructural abnormalities of the affected TGN in patients with TN. Our results suggest demyelination without significant axonal injury is the essential pathological basis of the affected TGN by multiple diffusion metrics. The correlation between FA reduction and VAS suggests FA as a potential objective MRI biomarker to correlate with clinical severity.},

Gray-white and pial surfaces were reconstructed and used to sample R1 at different cortical depths. Like myelination, R1 decreased from deeper to superficial layers. R1 decreased passing from V1 and MT, to immediately surrounding areas, then to the angular gyrus. High R1 was correlated across the cortex with convex local curvature so the data was first "de-curved". By overlaying R1 and retinotopic maps, we found that many visual area borders were associated with significant R1 increases including V1, V3A, MT, V6, V6A, V8/VO1, FST, and VIP. Surprisingly, retinotopic MT occupied only the posterior portion of an oval-shaped lateral occipital R1 maximum. R1 maps were reproducible within individuals and comparable between subjects without intensity normalization, enabling multi-center studies of development, aging, and disease progression, and structure/function mapping in other modalities.},

abstract = {Recently, local morphologic alterations of the brain in areas ascribable to the transmission of pain were reported in patients suffering from chronic pain. Although some authors discussed these findings as damage or loss of brain gray matter, one of the key questions is whether these structural alterations in the cerebral pain-transmitting network precede or succeed the chronicity of pain. We investigated 32 patients with chronic pain due to primary hip osteoarthritis and found a characteristic gray matter decrease in patients compared with controls in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right insular cortex and operculum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), amygdala, and brainstem. We then investigated a subgroup of these patients (n = 10) 6 weeks and 4 months after total hip replacement surgery, monitoring whole brain structure. After surgery, all 10 patients were completely pain free and we observed a gray matter increase in the DLPFC, ACC, amygdala, and brainstem. As gray matter decrease is at least partly reversible when pain is successfully treated, we suggest that the gray matter abnormalities found in chronic pain do not reflect brain damage but rather are a reversible consequence of chronic nociceptive transmission, which normalizes when the pain is adequately treated.},

abstract = {The mentalizing (theory of mind) system of the brain is probably in operation from ca. 18 months of age, allowing implicit attribution of intentions and other mental states. Between the ages of 4 and 6 years explicit mentalizing becomes possible, and from this age children are able to explain the misleading reasons that have given rise to a false belief. Neuroimaging studies of mentalizing have so far only been carried out in adults. They reveal a system with three components consistently activated during both implicit and explicit mentalizing tasks: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), temporal poles and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). The functions of these components can be elucidated, to some extent, from their role in other tasks used in neuroimaging studies. Thus, the MPFC region is probably the basis of the decoupling mechanism that distinguishes mental state representations from physical state representations; the STS region is probably the basis of the detection of agency, and the temporal poles might be involved in access to social knowledge in the form of scripts. The activation of these components in concert appears to be critical to mentalizing.},

abstract = {Chronic pain conditions are associated with abnormalities in brain structure and function. Moreover, some studies indicate that brain activity related to the subjective perception of chronic pain may be distinct from activity for acute pain. However, the latter are based on observations from cross-sectional studies. How brain activity reorganizes with transition from acute to chronic pain has remained unexplored. Here we study this transition by examining brain activity for rating fluctuations of back pain magnitude. First we compared back pain-related brain activity between subjects who have had the condition for ∼2 months with no prior history of back pain for 1 year (early, acute/subacute back pain group, n = 94), to subjects who have lived with back pain for {\textgreater}10 years (chronic back pain group, n = 59). In a subset of subacute back pain patients, we followed brain activity for back pain longitudinally over a 1-year period, and compared brain activity between those who recover (recovered acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 19) and those in which the back pain persists (persistent acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 20; based on a 20{\%} decrease in intensity of back pain in 1 year). We report results in relation to meta-analytic probabilistic maps related to the terms pain, emotion, and reward (each map is based on {\textgreater}200 brain imaging studies, derived from neurosynth.org). We observed that brain activity for back pain in the early, acute/subacute back pain group is limited to regions involved in acute pain, whereas in the chronic back pain group, activity is confined to emotion-related circuitry. Reward circuitry was equally represented in both groups. In the recovered acute/subacute back pain group, brain activity diminished in time, whereas in the persistent acute/subacute back pain group, activity diminished in acute pain regions, increased in emotion-related circuitry, and remained unchanged in reward circuitry. The results demonstrate that brain representation for a constant percept, back pain, can undergo large-scale shifts in brain activity with the transition to chronic pain. These observations challenge long-standing theoretical concepts regarding brain and mind relationships, as well as provide important novel insights regarding definitions and mechanisms of chronic pain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is often associated with neurovascular compression. However, intracranial tumors are occasionally observed, particularly when symptoms are atypical. We describe three patients with Type-1 TN and trigeminal schwannoma diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging, with concomitant arterial compression of the trigeminal nerve. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: All three patients had Type-1 TN with spontaneous onset, paroxysm-triggered pain, and response to antiepileptic medication. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated an ipsilateral enhancing perineural mass consistent with a schwannoma. Two of the three patients had previously undergone gamma knife radiosurgery without improvement. Subsequent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in all three patients revealed obvious compression of the trigeminal nerve by an arterial structure. INTERVENTION: Two patients underwent retrosigmoid craniectomy followed by microvascular decompression and remain pain-free. One patient elected not to pursue surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Although intracranial tumors are occasionally observed in patients with TN, neurovascular compression must still be considered as an etiology, especially if typical TN symptoms are reported},

abstract = {Precise localization of sulco-gyral structures of the human cerebral cortex is important for the interpretation of morpho-functional data, but requires anatomical expertise and is time consuming because of the brain's geometric complexity. Software developed to automatically identify sulco-gyral structures has improved substantially as a result of techniques providing topologically correct reconstructions permitting inflated views of the human brain. Here we describe a complete parcellation of the cortical surface using standard internationally accepted nomenclature and criteria. This parcellation is available in the FreeSurfer package. First, a computer-assisted hand parcellation classified each vertex as sulcal or gyral, and these were then subparcellated into 74 labels per hemisphere. Twelve datasets were used to develop rules and algorithms (reported here) that produced labels consistent with anatomical rules as well as automated computational parcellation. The final parcellation was used to build an atlas for automatically labeling the whole cerebral cortex. This atlas was used to label an additional 12 datasets, which were found to have good concordance with manual labels. This paper presents a precisely defined method for automatically labeling the cortical surface in standard terminology.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to treat intractable pain for over 50 years. Variations in targets and surgical technique complicate the interpretation of many studies. To better understand its efficacy, we performed a meta-analysis of DBS for pain relief. MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2003) databases were searched using key words deep brain stimulation, sensory thalamus, periventricular gray and pain. Inclusion criteria were based on patient characteristics and protocol clarity. Six studies (between 1977-1997) fitting the criteria were identified. Stimulation sites included the periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter (PVG/PAG), internal capsule (IC), and sensory thalamus (ST). The long-term pain alleviation rate was highest with DBS of the PVG/PAG (79{\%}), or the PVG/PAG plus sensory thalamus/internal capsule (87{\%}). Stimulation of the sensory thalamus alone was less effective (58{\%} long-term success) (p {\textless} 0.05). DBS was more effective for nociceptive than deafferentation pain (63{\%} vs 47{\%} long-term success; p {\textless} 0.01). Long-term success was attained in over 80{\%} of patients with intractable low back pain (failed back surgery) following successful trial stimulation. Trial stimulation was successful in approximately 50{\%} of those with post-stroke pain, and 58{\%} of patients permanently implanted achieved ongoing pain relief. Higher rates of success were seen with phantom limb pain and neuropathies. We conclude that DBS is frequently effective when used in well-selected patients. Neuroimaging and neuromodulation technology advances complicate the application of these results to modern practice. Ongoing investigations should shed further light on this complex clinical conundrum},

abstract = {Object The purpose of this study was to use MRI and histology to compare stereotactic lesioning modalities in a large brain model of thalamotomy. Methods A unilateral thalamotomy was performed in piglets utilizing one of 3 stereotactic lesioning modalities: focused ultrasound (FUS), radiofrequency, and radiosurgery. Standard clinical lesioning parameters were used for each treatment; and clinical, MRI, and histological assessments were made at early ({\textless} 72 hours), subacute (1 week), and later (1-3 months) time intervals. Results Histological and MRI assessment showed similar development for FUS and radiofrequency lesions. T2-weighted MRI revealed 3 concentric lesional zones at 48 hours with resolution of perilesional edema by 1 week. Acute ischemic infarction with macrophage infiltration was most prominent at 72 hours, with subsequent resolution of the inflammatory reaction and coalescence of the necrotic zone. There was no apparent difference in ischemic penumbra or "sharpness" between FUS or radiofrequency lesions. The radiosurgery lesions presented differently, with latent effects, less circumscribed lesions at 3 months, and apparent histological changes seen in white matter beyond the thalamic target. Additionally, thermal and radiation lesioning gradients were compared with modeling by dose to examine the theoretical penumbra. Conclusions In swine thalamus, FUS and radiosurgery lesions evolve similarly as determined by MRI, histological examination, and theoretical modeling. Radiosurgery produces lesions with more delayed effects and seemed to result in changes in the white matter beyond the thalamic target.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We sought to investigate the optimum b value for resolving crossing fiber using high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)-based multi-tensor tractography. The study tested the standard b values that are commonly used in the routine clinical setting. METHODS: Ten normal volunteers (five men and five women) with a mean age of 26.3 years (range, 22-32 years) were scanned using a 1.5-T clinical magnetic resonance unit. Single-shot echo-planar imaging was used for diffusion-weighted imaging with a diffusion-sensitizing gradient in 32 orientations. The b values of 700, 1,400, 2,100, and 2,800 s/m(2) were used. Data postprocessing was performed using multi-tensor methods. The depiction of the optic nerves, optic tracts, and decussation of superior cerebellar peduncles were assessed. RESULTS: The depictions of the nerve fibers were independent of the b values tested. CONCLUSION: The depiction of crossing fibers by HARDI-based multi-tensor tractography is not substantially influenced by b values ranging from 700 to 2,800 s/m(2). Thus, the optimum b value within this range may be the lowest one considering the higher signal to noise ratio},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The abducent nerve is difficult to identify reliably and consistently with conventional radiologic techniques. In this study, a 3D fast asymmetrical spin-echo MR imaging technique was used to obtain detailed images of the abducent nerve in normal volunteers. METHODS: The 3D fast asymmetrical spin-echo MR protocol was used to image the abducent nerves in 24 normal volunteers by using a 1-mm section thickness in the tilted axial and parasagittal planes. The microanatomy of the abducent nerve within Dorello's canal was also demonstrated in a cadaver study. RESULTS: In 24 normal volunteers, the anatomy of 47 abducent nerves was clearly depicted on MR images. The length of the cisternal segment of the abducent nerve, extending from the brain stem to its dural foramina, ranged from 6.7 to 19.6 mm (mean, 13.1 mm). The abducent nerves were at an angle of 5 to 90 degrees (mean, 24.5 degrees) to the clivus. CSF evagination was detected in the region of Dorello's canal in 36 (77{\%}) of 47 abducent nerves. The length of CSF evagination varied: 0.9 mm in five nerves, 1.0 to 1.9 mm in 18 nerves, 2.0 to 2.9 mm in eight nerves, and 3.0 mm or more in five nerves. Histologic examination of serial sections of the abducent nerve revealed that the petroclival segment of the nerve was covered by an envelope composed of an arachnoid cell layer. CONCLUSION: The course of the abducent nerve was reliably identified using the 3D fast asymmetrical spin-echo MR protocol and a histologically proven arachnoid envelope around the petroclival segment of the nerve was shown as CSF evagination into Dorello's canal by MR imaging},

We also studied anatomical TGN parameters (cross-sectional area [CSA] and volume [V]). Using DTI sequencing in a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, we measured the fraction of anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of TGN in 10 patients selected as candidates to have microvascular decompression (MVD) for TN, and 6 normal control subjects. We compared data between the affected nerves of TN (ipsilateral TN), unaffected nerves of TN (contralateral TN), and both nerves in normal subjects (controls), and correlated these data with CSA and V. The FA of the ipsilateral TN (0.37+/-0.08) was significantly lower (P{\textless}.05) compared with the contralateral TN (0.48+/-0.08) and control values (0.52+/-0.04). The ADC of ipsilateral TN (5.6+/-0.89 mm(2)/s) was significantly higher (P{\textless}.05) compared with the contralateral TN (4.26+/-0.59 mm(2)/s) and control values (3.84+/-0.43 mm(2)/s). Ipsilateral TN had less V and CSA compared with contralateral TN and control values (P{\textless}.05). The Spearman correlation coefficient showed a strong positive correlation between loss of FA and loss of V (r=0.7576) and loss of CSA (r=0.9273) of affected nerves. The Spearman correlation coefficient showed a strong negative correlation between increase in ADC and loss of V (r=-0.7173) and loss of CSA (r=-0.7416) in affected nerves. DTI revealed alteration in the FA and ADC values of the affected TGN. These alterations were correlated with atrophic changes in patients with TN caused by NVC},

abstract = {Based upon previous reports of alterations in white matter integrity and gray matter density in smokers, we examined these markers in a large, well-matched sample of smokers and non-smokers. We further investigated the effect of heavy cigarette exposure by using pack-years and the effects of two relatively stable, highly heritable traits in smokers (Fagerstr{\"{o}}m Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND), a measure of severity of nicotine dependence and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), a stable personality trait related to smoking). Forty-eight nicotine-dependent subjects and 48 matched controls were included in the analyses, with smokers also subdivided into high/low dependence and high/low pack-years smokers. White matter integrity (fractional anisotropy (FA)) and gray matter density (voxel-based morphometry (VBM)) were measured and compared across groups. Gray matter density was lower in left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in high pack-years smokers and was inversely related to pack-years. In contrast, left insular cortex gray matter density was higher in smokers and associated with TAS-20 total score and with difficulty-identifying-feelings factor. Further, the most highly dependent smokers showed lower prefrontal FA, which was negatively correlated with FTND. There was no correlation between pack-years and FTND in our smoker population. These data suggest chronic tobacco use is correlated with prefrontal gray matter damage , while differences in insula gray matter and PFC white matter appear to reflect stable and heritable differences between smokers and non-smokers.},

abstract = {There is a need for an imaging sequence that can provide high-resolution diffusion tensor images at 3T near air-tissue interfaces. By employing a radial fast spin-echo (FSE) collection in conjunction with magnitude filtered back-projection reconstruction, high-resolution diffusion-weighted images can be produced without susceptibility artifacts. However, violation of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) condition of diffusion prepared magnetization is a prominent problem for FSE trains that is magnified at higher fields. The unique aspect of violating the CPMG condition in trajectories that oversample the center of k-space and the implications for choosing the solution are examined. For collecting diffusion-weighted radial-FSE data at 3T we propose mixed-CPMG phase cycling of RF refocusing pulses combined with a 300{\%} wider refocusing than excitation slice. It is shown that this approach produces accurate diffusion values in a phantom, and can be used to collect undistorted, high-resolution diffusion tensor images of the human brain.},

abstract = {Tractography based on non-invasive diffusion imaging is central to the study of human brain connectivity. To date, the approach has not been systematically validated in ground truth studies. Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth tracts, we organized an open international tractography challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20 research groups. Here, we report the encouraging finding that most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing 90{\%} of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent). However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur systematically across research groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate and confirm fundamental ambiguities inherent in tract reconstruction based on orientation information alone, which need to be considered when interpreting tractography and connectivity results. Our approach provides a novel framework for estimating reliability of tractography and encourages innovation to address its current limitations.},

Experience with Beta-splines has shown that it is useful to endow a spline with shape parameters, used to modify the shape of the curve or surface independently of the defining control vertices. Thus it is desirable to construct a subclass of the Catmull-Rom splines that has shape parameters. We present such a class, some members of which are interpolating and others approximating. As was done for the Beta-spline, shape parameters are introduced by requiring geometric rather than parametric continuity. We demonstrate the practicality of several members of the class by developing efficient computational algorithms. A specific example of shape design using a low-degree member of the class is given.},

abstract = {The verrucae areae entorhinalis (VAE) are a characteristic feature of the human brain that occupy the anterior and posterolateral parts of the parahippocampal gyri and correspond to the islands of layer II neurons. We analyzed VAE in 60 neurologically normal subjects ranging from 23 to 85 years of age using a casting method. In 10 of these subjects the total number of neurons in the entorhinal islands was estimated stereologically using the optical fractionator. The number and surface area of VAE were higher in the left hemisphere compared with the right, and this leftward asymmetry was highly significant. Regression analysis showed a negative correlation between average VAE area and age in both hemispheres, representing a rate loss of about 800 microm2 per year. The estimated number of neurons obtained with the optical fractionator showed no significant difference between the left and the right hemisphere (468,000+/-144,000 vs. 405,000+/-117,000). There was a highly significant negative correlation between neuron numbers and age in both sides. In addition, clusters of small, undifferentiated layer II neurons ('heterotopias') were frequently observed in the rostral part of the entorhinal cortex in young and elderly adults. Layer II entorhinal neurons are among the first to show neurofibrillary changes during normal aging. The present data confirm the occurrence of age-related neuron loss in the entorhinal cortex. Considering the consistent projections from ipsilateral auditory association areas that, together with Broca's motor-speech area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45), show leftward asymmetry from early infancy (such as Brodmann area 22, planum temporale, and area 52 in the long insular gyrus), we speculate that functional lateralization of the human entorhinal cortex may be associated with specialization for memory processing related to language. Due to the dependence of hippocampal formation on entorhinal projections, this finding is also consistent with the greater capacity of the left hippocampus for verbal episodic memory.},

abstract = {Myelin damage, as seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases, impairs axonal conduction and can also be associated with axonal degeneration. Accurate assessments of these conditions may be highly beneficial in evaluating and selecting therapeutic strategies for patient management. Recently, an analytical approach examining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived parameters has been proposed to assess the extent of axonal damage, demyelination, or both. The current study uses the well-characterized cuprizone model of experimental demyelination and remyelination of corpus callosum in mouse brain to evaluate the ability of DTI parameters to detect the progression of myelin degeneration and regeneration. Our results demonstrate that the extent of increased radial diffusivity reflects the severity of demyelination in corpus callosum of mouse brain affected by cuprizone treatment. Subsequently, radial diffusivity decreases with the progression of remyelination. Furthermore, radial diffusivity changes were specific to the time course of changes in myelin integrity as distinct from axonal injury, which was detected by betaAPP immunostaining and shown to be most extensive prior to demyelination. Radial diffusivity offers a specific assessment of demyelination and remyelination, as distinct from acute axonal damage.},

abstract = {Mood and quality of life (QOL) outcomes vary widely in neuropathic pain trials. This may be a result of variable analgesia and other treatment effects. We evaluated the relationship between pain reduction and mood/QOL in neuropathic pain. Pain, side effects, QOL, and mood from a trial of morphine, gabapentin, and a morphine-gabapentin combination were examined. Baseline QOL was impaired according to Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores. Baseline mood, according to Profile of Mood States scores, was comparable to that of a nondepressed population. Pain reduction with all three active trial treatments correlated with improved QOL. Pain reduction with morphine and with gabapentin correlated with improved mood. Pain reduction with a morphine-gabapentin combination correlated with improvement in only one of several domains of the Profile of Mood States. Severity of sedation, constipation, and dry mouth during any treatment did not correlate with mood/QOL changes. These results can be interpreted to imply that larger analgesic treatment effect sizes lead to more substantial improvements in QOL and/or mood. However, other beneficial or adverse treatment-related side effects may also affect mood/QOL. Therefore, future studies are needed to also evaluate the impact of treatment-related side effects on mood/QOL in analgesic trials},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that axonal damage, and not demyelination, is the primary cause of long-term neurological impairment in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The axial and radial diffusivities derived from diffusion tensor imaging have shown promise as non-invasive surrogate markers of axonal damage and demyelination, respectively. In this study, in vivo diffusion tensor imaging of the spinal cords from mice with chronic EAE was performed to determine if axial diffusivity correlated with neurological disability in EAE assessed by the commonly used clinical scoring system. Axial diffusivity in the ventrolateral white matter showed a significant negative correlation with EAE clinical score and was significantly lower in mice with severe EAE than in mice with moderate EAE. Furthermore, the greater decreases in axial diffusivity were associated with greater amounts of axonal damage, as confirmed by quantitative staining for non-phosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI32). Radial diffusivity and relative anisotropy could not distinguish between the groups of mice with moderate EAE and those with severe EAE. The results further the notion that axial diffusivity is a non-invasive marker of axonal damage in white matter and could provide the necessary link between pathology and neurological disability},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20{\%} relative improvement to 62.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although global brain structure is highly heritable, there is still variability in the magnitude of genetic influences on the size of specific regions. Yet, little is known about the patterning of those genetic influences, i.e., whether the same genes influence structure throughout the brain or whether there are regionally specific sets of genes. METHODS: We mapped the heritability of cortical thickness throughout the brain using three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging in 404 middle-aged male twins. To assess the amount of genetic overlap between regions, we then mapped genetic correlations between three selected seed points and all other points comprising the continuous cortical surface. RESULTS: There was considerable regional variability in the magnitude of genetic influences on cortical thickness. The primary visual (V1) seed point had strong genetic correlations with posterior sensory and motor areas. The anterior temporal seed point had strong genetic correlations with anterior frontal regions but not with V1. The middle frontal seed point had strong genetic correlations with inferior parietal regions. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide strong evidence of regionally specific patterns rather than a single, global genetic factor. The patterns are largely consistent with a division between primary and association cortex, as well as broadly defined patterns of brain gene expression, neuroanatomical connectivity, and brain maturation trajectories, but no single explanation appears to be sufficient. The patterns do not conform to traditionally defined brain structure boundaries. This approach can serve as a step toward identifying novel phenotypes for genetic association studies of psychiatric disorders and normal and pathological cognitive aging},

The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, using deoxyhemoglobin as an endogenous paramagnetic contrast agent, exposes regions of interest in task-based and resting-state paradigms. However the BOLD contrast is at best a partial measure of neuronal activity, because the functional maps obtained by differencing or correlations ignore the total neuronal activity in the baseline state. Here we describe how studies of brain energy metabolism at Yale, especially with (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and related techniques, contributed to development of quantitative functional brain imaging with fMRI by providing a reliable measurement of baseline energy. This narrative takes us on a journey, from molecules to mind, with illuminating insights about neuronal-glial activities in relation to energy demand of synaptic activity.

abstract = {The frontal aslant tract is a direct pathway connecting Broca's region with the anterior cingulate and pre-supplementary motor area. This tract is left lateralized in right-handed subjects, suggesting a possible role in language. However, there are no previous studies that have reported an involvement of this tract in language disorders. In this study we used diffusion tractography to define the anatomy of the frontal aslant tract in relation to verbal fluency and grammar impairment in primary progressive aphasia. Thirty-five patients with primary progressive aphasia and 29 control subjects were recruited. Tractography was used to obtain indirect indices of microstructural organization of the frontal aslant tract. In addition, tractography analysis of the uncinate fasciculus, a tract associated with semantic processing deficits, was performed. Damage to the frontal aslant tract correlated with performance in verbal fluency as assessed by the Cinderella story test. Conversely, damage to the uncinate fasciculus correlated with deficits in semantic processing as assessed by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Neither tract correlated with grammatical or repetition deficits. Significant group differences were found in the frontal aslant tract of patients with the non-fluent/agrammatic variant and in the uncinate fasciculus of patients with the semantic variant. These findings indicate that degeneration of the frontal aslant tract underlies verbal fluency deficits in primary progressive aphasia and further confirm the role of the uncinate fasciculus in semantic processing. The lack of correlation between damage to the frontal aslant tract and grammar deficits suggests that verbal fluency and grammar processing rely on distinct anatomical networks.},

abstract = {Myofascial pain of the temporomandibular region (M-TMD) is a common, but poorly understood chronic disorder. It is unknown whether the condition is a peripheral problem, or a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). To investigate possible CNS substrates of M-TMD, we compared the brain morphology of 15 women with M-TMD to that of 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. High-resolution structural brain and brainstem scans were carried out using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and data were analyzed using a voxel-based morphometry approach. The M-TMD group evidenced decreased or increased gray matter volume compared to controls in several areas of the trigeminothalamocortical pathway, including brainstem trigeminal sensory nuclei, the thalamus, and the primary somatosensory cortex. In addition, M-TMD individuals showed increased gray matter volume compared to controls in limbic regions such as the posterior putamen, globus pallidus, and anterior insula. Within the M-TMD group, jaw pain, pain tolerance, and pain duration were differentially associated with brain and brainstem gray matter volume. Self-reported pain severity was associated with increased gray matter in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate. Sensitivity to pressure algometry was associated with decreased gray matter in the pons, corresponding to the trigeminal sensory nuclei. Longer pain duration was associated with greater gray matter in the posterior cingulate, hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum. The pattern of gray matter abnormality found in M-TMD individuals suggests the involvement of trigeminal and limbic system dysregulation, as well as potential somatotopic reorganization in the putamen, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex.},

abstract = {Using a radial maze task and different postoperative recovery periods, this experiment assessed and compared the reference and working memory performances of adult Long-Evans male rats subjected to entorhinal cortex, fimbria-fornix, and hippocampus lesions. Sham-operated rats were used as controls. In order to see whether the duration of the postsurgical recovery period would influence acquisition of the complex radial maze task, training began 1 month following surgery (Delay 1) for half the rats in each group, while for the other half training was started 6.5 months following surgery (Delay 2). The results indicated that at both recovery periods the entorhinal cortex lesions failed to affect either working or reference memory in the spatial task. Conversely, both fimbria-fornix and hippocampus lesions impaired both reference and working memory. While the reference memory deficit was generally similar in both fimbria-fornix and hippocampal lesion groups, analysis of the results for working memory indicated that at the longer delay rats with fimbria-fornix lesions were still impaired but in animals that had the hippocampus removed, working memory did not differ from that of controls. These results suggest that there was some recovery in those rats with hippocampal lesions (e.g., on the working memory task) but both hippocampal and fimbria-fornix animals were still impaired compared to controls when training was delayed 6.5 months following the operations.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Gamma knife surgery (GKS) has emerged as a suitable treatment of pharmacologically resistant idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. The optimal radiation dose and target for this therapy, however, remain to be defined. The authors analyzed the results of GKS in which a high dose of radiation and a distal target was used, to determine the best parameters for this treatment. METHODS: The authors evaluated results in 47 patients who were treated with this approach. All patients underwent clinical and magnetic resonance imaging examinations at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year post-GKS. Fifteen potential prognostic factors associated with favorable pain control were studied. The mean follow-up period was 16 months (range 6-42 months). The initial pain relief was excellent (100{\%} pain control) in 32 patients, good (90-99{\%} pain control) in seven patients, fair (50-89{\%} pain control) in three patients, and poor ({\textless} 50{\%} pain control) in five patients. The actuarial curve of pain relief displayed a 59{\%} rate of excellent pain control and a 71{\%} excellent or good pain control at 42 months after radiosurgery. Radiosurgery-induced facial numbness was bothersome for two patients and mild for 18 patients. Three prognostic factors were found to be statistically significant factors for successful pain relief: a shorter distance between the target and the brainstem, a higher radiation dose delivered to the brainstem, and the development of a facial sensory disturbance after radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: To optimize pain control and minimize complications of this therapy, we recommend that the nerve be targeted at a distance of 5 to 8 mm from the brainstem},

abstract = {The role of operculo-insular region in the processing of somato-sensory inputs, painful or not, is now well established. However, available maps from previous literature show a substantial overlap of cortical areas activated by these stimuli, and the region referred to as the "secondary somatosensory area (SII)" is widely distributed in the parietal operculum. Differentiating SII from posterior insula cortex, which is anatomically contiguous, is not easy, explaining why the "operculo-insular" label has been introduced to describe activations by somatosensory stimuli in this cortical region. Based on the recent cyto-architectural parcellation of the human insular/SII cortices (Eickhoff et al., 2006, Kurth et al., 2010), the present study investigates with functional MRI (fMRI), whether these structural subdivisions could subserve distinct aspects of discriminative somato-sensory functions, including pain. Responses to five types of stimuli applied on the left hand of 25 healthy volunteers were considered: i) tactile stimuli; ii) passive movements; iii) innocuous cold stimuli; iv) non-noxious warm and v) heat pain. Our results show different patterns of activation depending on the type of somato-sensory stimulation. The posterior part of SII (OP1 area), contralateral to stimuli, was the only sub-region activated by all type of stimuli and might therefore be considered as a common cortical target for different types of somato-sensory inputs. Proprioceptive stimulation by passive finger movements activated the posterior part of SII (OP1 sub-region) bilaterally and the contralateral median part of insula (PreCG and MSG). Innocuous cooling activated the contralateral posterior part of SII (OP1) and the dorsal posterior and median part of insula (OP2, PostCG). Pain stimuli induced the most widespread and intense activation that was bilateral in SII (OP1, OP4) and distributed to all sub-regions of contralateral insula (except OP2) and to the anterior part of the ipsilateral insula (PreCG, MSG, ASG). However, the posterior granular part of insula contralateral to stimulus (Ig area) and the anterior part of SII bilaterally (OP4) were specifically activated during pain stimulation. This raises the question whether these latter areas could be the anatomical substrate of the sensory-discriminative processing of thermal pain},

abstract = {Myelin loss and axonal damage are both observed in white matter injuries. Each may have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients. Currently, there does not exist a noninvasive biological marker that enables differentiation between myelin and axonal injury. We describe herein the use of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to quantify the effect of dysmyelination on water directional diffusivities in brains of shiverer mice in vivo. The principal diffusion eigenvalues of eight axonal fiber tracts that can be identified with certainty on DTI maps were measured. The water diffusivity perpendicular to axonal fiber tracts, lambda(perpendicular), was significantly higher in shiverer mice compared with age-matched controls, reflecting the lack of myelin and the increased freedom of cross-fiber diffusion in white matter. The water diffusivity parallel to axonal fiber tracts, lambda(parallel), was not different, which is consistent with the presence of intact axons. It is clear that dysmyelination alone does not impact lambda(parallel). The presence of intact axons in the setting of incomplete myelination was confirmed by electron microscopy. Although further validation is still needed, our finding suggests that changes in lambda(perpendicular) and lambda(parallel) may potentially be used to differentiate myelin loss versus axonal injury.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of developing unique, neural circuitry-based treatments for the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) was the impetus for a phase I study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with AD that targeted the fornix. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that DBS would increase cerebral glucose metabolism in cortical and hippocampal circuits and that increased metabolism would be correlated with better clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Open-label trial. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: A total of 5 patients with mild, probable AD (1 woman and 4 men, with a mean [SD] age of 62.6 [4.2] years). INTERVENTION: Deep brain stimulation of the fornix. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients underwent clinical follow-up and high-resolution positron emission tomography studies of cerebral glucose metabolism after 1 year of DBS. RESULTS: Functional connectivity analyses revealed that 1 year of DBS increased cerebral glucose metabolism in 2 orthogonal networks: a frontal-temporal-parietal-striatal-thalamic network and a frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital-hippocampal network. In similar cortical regions, higher baseline metabolism prior to DBS and increased metabolism after 1 year of DBS were correlated with better outcomes in global cognition, memory, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Increased connectivity after 1 year of DBS is observed, which is in contrast to the decreased connectivity observed over the course of AD. The persistent cortical metabolic increases after 1 year of DBS were associated with better clinical outcomes in this patient sample and are greater in magnitude and more extensive in the effects on cortical circuitry compared with the effects reported for pharmacotherapy over 1 year in AD.},

abstract = {Neurovascular contact is considered a frequent cause of classical trigeminal neuralgia and microvascular decompression with transposition of a blood vessel is preferred over other surgical options in medically refractory patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia. However, the prevalence of neurovascular contact has not been investigated in a representative cohort of patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia based in a neurological setting and using high-quality neuroimaging and blinded evaluation. We aimed to investigate whether presence and degree of neurovascular contact are correlated to pain side in classical trigeminal neuralgia. Consecutive classical trigeminal neuralgia patients with unilateral symptoms were referred to 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging and included in a cross-sectional study. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were evaluated blindly and graded according to presence and degree of neurovascular contact. Severe neurovascular contact was defined as displacement or atrophy of the trigeminal nerve. A total of 135 patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia were included. Average age of disease onset was 53.0 years (95{\%} confidence interval mean 40.5-55.5) and current age was 60.1 years (95{\%} {\%} confidence interval mean 57.5-62.7). Eighty-two (61{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval 52-69{\%}) patients were female. Neurovascular contact was prevalent both on the symptomatic and asymptomatic side [89{\%} versus 78{\%}, P = 0.014, odds ratio = 2.4 (1.2-4.8), P = 0.017], while severe neurovascular contact was highly prevalent on the symptomatic compared to the asymptomatic side [53{\%} versus 13{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001, odds ratio = 11.6 (4.7-28.9), P {\textless} 0.001]. Severe neurovascular contact was caused by arteries in 98{\%}. We conclude that neurovascular contact causing displacement or atrophy of the trigeminal nerve is highly associated with the symptomatic side in classical trigeminal neuralgia as opposed to neurovascular contact in general. Our findings demonstrate that severe neurovascular contact is involved in the aetiology of classical trigeminal neuralgia and that it is caused by arteries located in the root entry zone.},

abstract = {Rats were trained in a lateralized reaching motor task during either an 'early' (22-31 days old) or a 'late' (62-71 days old) postnatal period. The 'late' group showed significant neuronal density reduction in cortical layers II-III of the contralateral motor forelimb representation. The 'early' group evidenced a similar localized contralateral effect that persisted after a subsequent period without training. Furthermore, in this group, a bilateral overall decrease in neuronal density was found throughout the motor cortex. This bilateral experience and age-dependent effect is conceivably related to a critical period of motor cortical development. The localized reduction of neuronal density strongly indicates a morphological expression of the motor engram. Our present study supports the concept that the acquisition and retention of motor learning involves the persistence of structural changes in the brain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: True 3D measurements of tumor volume are time-consuming and subject to errors that are particularly pronounced in cases of small tumors. These problems complicate the routine clinical assessment of tumor growth rates. We examined the accuracy of currently available methods of size and growth measurement of vestibular schwannomas compared with that of a novel fast partial volume tissue classification algorithm. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with unilateral sporadic vestibular schwannomas underwent imaging. Thirty-eight of these patients underwent imaging two or more times at approximately 12-month intervals. Contrast-enhanced 3D T1-weighted images were used for all measurements. An experienced radiologist performed standard size estimations, including maximal diameter, elliptical area, perimeter, manually segmented area, intensity thresholded seeding volume, and manually segmented volume. A method for calculating volume was also used, incorporating Bayesian probability statistics to estimate partial volume effects. Manually segmented volume was obtained as a baseline standard measure. A computer-generated phantom exhibiting the intensity and partial volume characteristics of brain tissue, CSF, and intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma tissue was used to measure absolute accuracy of the standard technique and Bayesian partial volume segmentation. RESULTS: The Bayesian partial volume segmentation method showed the highest correlation (R(2) = 0.994) with the standard method, whereas the commonly used method of maximal diameter measurement showed poor correlation (R(2) = 0.732). Accuracy of Bayesian segmentation was shown to be more than twice that of manual segmentation, with an absolute accuracy of 5{\%} (cf, 13{\%}) and a remeasurement accuracy of 70 mm(3) (cf, 150 mm(3)). For the 38 patients who underwent imaging twice, definite tumor growth was shown for 12, potential growth for seven, no growth for 17, and definite shrinkage for two. CONCLUSION: Commonly used methods such as maximal diameter measurements do not provide adequate statistical accuracy with which to monitor tumor growth in patients with small vestibular schwannomas. Bayesian partial volume segmentation provides a more accurate and rapid method of volume and growth estimation. These differences in measurement accuracy translated into a significant improvement in clinical assessment, allowing identification of tumor growth in 10 of 12 cases that appeared to be static in size when manual segmentation techniques are used. The technique is quick to perform and suitable for use in routine clinical practice.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that the hypothalamus helps to control ageing, but the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Here we develop several mouse models in which hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that co-express Sox2 and Bmi1 are ablated, as we observed that ageing in mice started with a substantial loss of these hypothalamic cells. Each mouse model consistently displayed acceleration of ageing-like physiological changes or a shortened lifespan. Conversely, ageing retardation and lifespan extension were achieved in mid-aged mice that were locally implanted with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that had been genetically engineered to survive in the ageing-related hypothalamic inflammatory microenvironment. Mechanistically, hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells contributed greatly to exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cerebrospinal fluid, and these exosomal miRNAs declined during ageing, whereas central treatment with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cell-secreted exosomes led to the slowing of ageing. In conclusion, ageing speed is substantially controlled by hypothalamic stem cells, partially through the release of exosomal miRNAs.},

Magnetic fields were recorded by a 37-channel BTi biomagnetometer from the hemisphere contralateral to the site of stimulation. The power of the early evoked magnetic field ({\textless} 100 ms) elicited by painful stimulation of the painful back in very chronic patients was elevated relative to that elicited by painful back stimulation of healthy controls and showed a linear increase with chronicity (r = 0.74). The maximum activity elicited in primary somatosensory cortex was shifted more medially in the very chronic back pain subjects.

abstract = {For the last decade, it has been shown that neuroimaging can be a potential tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and also fusion of different modalities can further provide the complementary information to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Here, we focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)2 2 Although it is clear from the context that the acronym DBM denotes "Deep Boltzmann Machine" in this paper, we would clearly indicate that DBM here is not related to "Deformation Based Morphometry"., a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs. healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter, we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35{\%}, 85.67{\%}, and 74.58{\%}, respectively, outperforming the competing methods. By visual inspection of the trained model, we observed that the proposed method could hierarchically discover the complex latent patterns inherent in both MRI and PET. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various types of pathologic mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS) can alter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals, and the appearance of remyelinated lesions on MRI is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To describe the MRI appearance of remyelinated lesions in MS. DESIGN: Comparison of postmortem MRI findings with histopathologic findings. SETTING: Brain donations from a general community. Patients Magnetic resonance images from 36 rapid autopsies yielded 161 areas that could be matched with histologic characteristics, including 149 focal T2-weighted abnormalities, with a range of signal intensities on T1-weighted images. In a subset of 49 lesions, magnetization transfer ratio could be determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An observer blinded to the MRI findings assessed the presence of remyelination using light microscopic criteria; in 25 areas, in situ hybridization was used to assess the presence of oligodendrocytes expressing proteolipid protein messenger RNA. RESULTS: Remyelinated areas were found in 67 lesions (42{\%}): partial remyelination was present in 30 lesions (19{\%}), whereas 37 lesions (23{\%}) were fully remyelinated. Remyelinated lesions contained enhanced numbers of oligodendrocytes containing proteolipid protein messenger RNA. All areas with remyelination shown histopathologically were hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Strong hypointensity on T1-weighted images was significantly associated (chi2 = 29.8, P{\textless}.001) with demyelinated and partially remyelinated lesions compared with fully remyelinated lesions. The magnetization transfer ratio of remyelinated lesions (mean [SD], 27.6{\%} [41{\%}]) differed (F = 46.3, P{\textless}.001) from both normal-appearing white matter (35.2{\%} [32{\%}]) and demyelinated lesions (22.3{\%} [48{\%}]). CONCLUSIONS: Remyelinated lesions return an abnormal signal on T2-weighted images. Both T1-weighted images and magnetization transfer ratio may have (limited) additional value in separating lesions with and without remyelination},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate image classification with computational resource limits at test time. Two such settings are: 1. anytime classification, where the network's prediction for a test example is progressively updated, facilitating the output of a prediction at any time; and 2. budgeted batch classification, where a fixed amount of computation is available to classify a set of examples that can be spent unevenly across "easier" and "harder" inputs. In contrast to most prior work, such as the popular Viola and Jones algorithm, our approach is based on convolutional neural networks. We train multiple classifiers with varying resource demands, which we adaptively apply during test time. To maximally re-use computation between the classifiers, we incorporate them as early-exits into a single deep convolutional neural network and inter-connect them with dense connectivity. To facilitate high quality classification early on, we use a two-dimensional multi-scale network architecture that maintains coarse and fine level features all-throughout the network. Experiments on three image-classification tasks demonstrate that our framework substantially improves the existing state-of-the-art in both settings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate directional diffusivities within the optic nerve in a first event of acute optic neuritis to determine whether decreased axial diffusivity (AD) would predict 6-month visual outcome and optic nerve integrity measures. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Academic multiple sclerosis center. Patients Referred sample of 25 individuals who presented within 31 days after acute visual symptoms consistent with optic neuritis. Visits were scheduled at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). RESULTS: An incomplete 6-month visual recovery was associated with a lower baseline AD (1.50 mum(2)/ms [95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, 1.36-1.64 mum(2)/ms for incomplete recovery vs 1.75 mum(2)/ms [95{\%} CI, 1.67-1.83 mum(2)/ms] for complete recovery). Odds of complete recovery decreased by 53{\%} (95{\%} CI, 27{\%}-70{\%}) for every 0.1-unit decrease in baseline AD. A lower baseline AD correlated with worse 6-month visual outcomes in visual acuity (r = 0.40, P = .03), contrast sensitivity (r = 0.41, P = .02), VEP amplitude (r = 0.55, P {\textless} .01), VEP latency (r = -0.38, P = .04), and RNFL thickness (r = 0.53, P = .02). Radial diffusivity increased between months 1 and 3 to become higher in those with incomplete recovery at 12 months than in those with complete recovery (1.45 mum(2)/ms [95{\%} CI, 1.31-1.59 mum(2)/ms] vs 1.19 mum(2)/ms [95{\%} CI, 1.10-1.28 mum(2)/ms]). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased AD in acute optic neuritis was associated with a worse 6-month visual outcome and correlated with VEP and RNFL measures of axon and myelin injury. Axial diffusivity may serve as a marker of axon injury in acute white matter injury},

Diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking adds essential information for preoperative planning in neurosurgical practice. Integration of the tractography into neuronavigation system makes it possible for the intraoperative visualization of the major fiber tracts. It may help increase the likelihood of the total resection of tumors adjacent to the eloquent fiber tracts and avoid new neurologic deficits after surgery. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report our valuable experience of such integration for the resection of a deeply located brainstem cavernous angioma.

abstract = {White matter disruption is an important determinant of cognitive impairment after brain injury, but conventional neuroimaging underestimates its extent. In contrast, diffusion tensor imaging provides a validated and sensitive way of identifying the impact of axonal injury. The relationship between cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury and white matter damage is likely to be complex. We applied a flexible technique-tract-based spatial statistics-to explore whether damage to specific white matter tracts is associated with particular patterns of cognitive impairment. The commonly affected domains of memory, executive function and information processing speed were investigated in 28 patients in the post-acute/chronic phase following traumatic brain injury and in 26 age-matched controls. Analysis of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity maps revealed widespread differences in white matter integrity between the groups. Patients showed large areas of reduced fractional anisotropy, as well as increased mean and axial diffusivities, compared with controls, despite the small amounts of cortical and white matter damage visible on standard imaging. A stratified analysis based on the presence or absence of microbleeds (a marker of diffuse axonal injury) revealed diffusion tensor imaging to be more sensitive than gradient-echo imaging to white matter damage. The location of white matter abnormality predicted cognitive function to some extent. The structure of the fornices was correlated with associative learning and memory across both patient and control groups, whilst the structure of frontal lobe connections showed relationships with executive function that differed in the two groups. These results highlight the complexity of the relationships between white matter structure and cognition. Although widespread and, sometimes, chronic abnormalities of white matter are identifiable following traumatic brain injury, the impact of these changes on cognitive function is likely to depend on damage to key pathways that link nodes in the distributed brain networks supporting high-level cognitive functions.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The reproducibility of three evaluation techniques for high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data, the diffusion tensor model, q-ball reconstruction and spherical deconvolution, are compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two healthy volunteers were measured in a 3 T MR system six times with the same measurement parameters; one subject was measured with different b-values. The data was evaluated to compare the consistency and reproducibility of reconstructed diffusion directions and anisotropy values for the three investigated diffusion evaluation techniques. The angle difference between the reconstructed main directions of diffusion for the investigated techniques was evaluated. For q-ball and spherical deconvolution the consistency of the second dominant diffusion direction was additionally examined. RESULTS: The differences between the tensor model and q-ball or spherical deconvolution in the estimated diffusion direction decrease with an increase in fractional anisotropy. Increasing the smoothing kernel in q-ball reconstruction renders the results similar to the ones from the diffusion tensor evaluation. Consistency in the reconstructed directions did increase for larger b-values. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of HARDI data in clinical conditions with q-ball or spherical deconvolution shows consistency and reproducibility similar to the diffusion tensor model, but provides valuable additional information about a second dominant direction of diffusion.},

abstract = {Geometric distortions of echo-planar images produced by the strong eddy currents present in the diffusion tensor imaging experiment are a major confound to the accurate quantification of diffusion coefficients, and measures of diffusion anisotropy based upon them. Here we investigate how the method of iterative cross-correlation (ICC) of baseline and diffusion- weighted images (DWIs) originally proposed by Haselgrove and Moore (Magn. Reson. Med. 36:960-964; 1996) can be extended to correct high b-value DWIs, without the need for extrapolation of distortion parameters determined from low b-value images. Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic brain images show that the maximum value of the trace of the b-matrix, Tr(b), at which distorted DWIs can be accurately corrected by direct comparison with the undistorted baseline image is approximately 300 s mm-2. Removal of the cerebrospinal fluid signal greatly extends this value of Tr(b) (up to approximately 2000 s mm-2), thereby allowing direct comparison of baseline and distorted images. The use of ICC distortion parameters determined from separate calibrations of water phantom images is also investigated, and found to be effective in correcting geometric distortions observed in the DWIs collected as part of a human volunteer diffusion tensor imaging study. This work suggests that distorted DWIs acquired at high values of b may be corrected using the ICC algorithm without collecting additional low b-value images, thus allowing simplified methods of measuring the apparent diffusion tensor D, based on collecting a small number of DWIs, to be implemented in quantitative patient examinations.},

Subgroups of motor neurons of the brainstem and the spinal cord expressing low amounts of Ca2+ buffering proteins are particularly vulnerable. In ALS, chronic excitotoxicity mediated by Ca2+-permeable AMPA type glutamate receptors seems to initiate a self-perpetuating process of intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation with consecutive endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ depletion and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. The only known effective treatment, riluzole, seems to reduce glutamatergic input. This review introduces the hypothesis of a "toxic shift of Ca2+" within the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria Ca2+ cycle (ERMCC) as a key mechanism in motor neuron degeneration, and discusses molecular targets which may be of interest for future ERMCC modulating neuroprotective therapies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is characterized by core symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that these behavioral disturbances are associated with abnormal functional connectivity among brain regions. However, the alterations in the structural connections that underlie these behavioral and functional deficits remain poorly understood. Here, we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography method to examine whole-brain white matter (WM) structural connectivity in 30 drug-naive boys with ADHD and 30 healthy controls. The WM networks of the human brain were constructed by estimating inter-regional connectivity probability. The topological properties of the resultant networks (e.g., small-world and network efficiency) were then analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Nonparametric permutation tests were applied for between-group comparisons of these graphic metrics. We found that both the ADHD and control groups showed an efficient small-world organization in the whole-brain WM networks, suggesting a balance between structurally segregated and integrated connectivity patterns. However, relative to controls, patients with ADHD exhibited decreased global efficiency and increased shortest path length, with the most pronounced efficiency decreases in the left parietal, frontal, and occipital cortices. Intriguingly, the ADHD group showed decreased structural connectivity in the prefrontal-dominant circuitry and increased connectivity in the orbitofrontal-striatal circuitry, and these changes significantly correlated with the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, respectively. The present study shows disrupted topological organization of large-scale WM networks in ADHD, extending our understanding of how structural disruptions of neuronal circuits underlie behavioral disturbances in patients with ADHD.},

abstract = {Numerous deep learning applications benefit from multi-task learning with multiple regression and classification objectives. In this paper we make the observation that the performance of such systems is strongly dependent on the relative weighting between each task's loss. Tuning these weights by hand is a difficult and expensive process, making multi-task learning prohibitive in practice. We propose a principled approach to multi-task deep learning which weighs multiple loss functions by considering the homoscedastic uncertainty of each task. This allows us to simultaneously learn various quantities with different units or scales in both classification and regression settings. We demonstrate our model learning per-pixel depth regression, semantic and instance segmentation from a monocular input image. Perhaps surprisingly, we show our model can learn multi-task weightings and outperform separate models trained individually on each task.},

However, neural processes associated with empathic processing have not yet been directly examined in psychopathy, especially in response to the perception of other people in pain and distress.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To identify potential differences in patterns of neural activity in incarcerated individuals with psychopathy and incarcerated persons serving as controls during the perception of empathy-eliciting stimuli depicting other people experiencing pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: In a case-control study, brain activation patterns elicited by dynamic stimuli depicting individuals being harmed and facial expressions of pain were compared between incarcerated individuals with psychopathy and incarcerated controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Participants were scanned on the grounds of a correctional facility using the Mind Research Network's mobile 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Eighty incarcerated men were classified according to scores on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) as high (27 men; PCL-R, ≥30), intermediate (28 men; PCL-R, 21-29), or low (25 men; PCL-R, ≤20) levels of psychopathy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Neurohemodynamic response to empathy-eliciting dynamic scenarios revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Participants in the psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray relative to controls but showed greater activation in the insula, which was positively correlated with scores on both PCL-R factors 1 and 2.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In response to pain and distress cues expressed by others, individuals with psychopathy exhibit deficits in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex regardless of stimulus type and display selective impairment in processing facial cues of distress in regions associated with cognitive mentalizing. A better understanding of the neural responses to empathy-eliciting stimuli in psychopathy is necessary to inform intervention programs.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI allows the structural connectivity of the whole brain (the 'tractogram') to be estimated in vivo non-invasively using streamline tractography. The biological accuracy of these data sets is however limited by the inherent biases associated with the reconstruction method. Here we propose a method to retrospectively improve the accuracy of these reconstructions, by selectively filtering out streamlines from the tractogram in a manner that improves the fit between the streamline reconstruction and the underlying diffusion images. This filtering is guided by the results of spherical deconvolution of the diffusion signal, hence the acronym SIFT: spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms. Data sets processed by this algorithm show a marked reduction in known reconstruction biases, and improved biological plausibility. Emerging methods in diffusion MRI, particularly those that aim to characterise and compare the structural connectivity of the brain, should benefit from the improved accuracy of the reconstruction.},

abstract = {A new propeller EPI pulse sequence with reduced sensitivity to field inhomogeneities is proposed. Image artifacts such as blurring due to Nyquist ghosting and susceptibility gradients are investigated and compared with those obtained in previous propeller EPI studies. The proposed propeller EPI sequence uses a readout that is played out along the short axis of the propeller blade, orthogonal to the readout used in previous propeller methods. In contrast to long-axis readout propeller EPI, this causes the echo spacing between two consecutive phase-encoding (PE) lines to decrease, which in turn increases the k-space velocity in this direction and hence the pseudo-bandwidth. Long- and short-axis propeller EPI, and standard single-shot EPI sequences were compared on phantoms and a healthy volunteer. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was also performed on the volunteer. Short-axis propeller EPI produced considerably fewer image artifacts compared to the other two sequences. Further, the oblique blades for the long-axis propeller EPI were also prone to one order of magnitude higher residual ghosting than the proposed short-axis propeller EPI.},

abstract = {Invasive neurostimulation therapies may be proposed to patients with neuropathic pain refractory to conventional medical management, in order to improve pain relief, functional capacity, and quality of life. In this review, the respective mechanisms of action and efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), nerve root stimulation (NRS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and motor cortex stimulation (MCS) are discussed. PNS appears to be useful in various refractory neuropathic pain indications (as long as there is some preservation of sensation in the painful area), such as intractable chronic headache, pelvic and perineal pain, and low back pain, but evidence for its efficacy is not strongly conclusive, and large-scale randomized controlled studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy in the long term. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been validated for the treatment of selected types of chronic pain syndromes, such as Failed Back Surgery Syndrome, and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type I. When neuropathic pain is secondary to a brain lesion (especially following stroke) or a trigeminal lesion, stimulation of brain structures is required. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), which can be proposed with targets like the periventricular/periaqueductal gray matter or the sensory thalamus, is increasingly replaced by motor cortex stimulation (MCS), mainly because it is safer, more easily performed, and probably more effective in a wider range of indications (including central post-stroke pain). The respective places of DBS and MCS in some selected indications, such as peripheral neuropathic pain and phantom limb pain, have yet to be clearly delineated. Controlled trials, with the stimulator switched ON or OFF in a double-blind procedure, have demonstrated the efficacy of MCS in the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain, although these trials included a limited number of patients and need to be confirmed by large, controlled, multicenter studies. Despite technical progress in neurosurgical navigation, guided by neuroimaging and intraoperative electrophysiology to optimize electrode positioning, MCS results are still variable, and validated criteria for selecting good candidates for implantation are lacking, except clinical response to preoperative rTMS, which showed correlations with a good response to MCS-induced analgesia. However, the evidence in favor of this technique is sufficient to include it in the range of treatment options for refractory neuropathic pain},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many biological, behavioral, social, and environmental factors may contribute to the delay or prevention of cognitive decline. PURPOSE: To summarize evidence about putative risk and protective factors for cognitive decline in older adults and the effects of interventions for preserving cognition. DATA SOURCES: English-language publications in MEDLINE, HuGEpedia, AlzGene, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1984 through 27 October 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies with 300 or more participants and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) with 50 or more adult participants who were 50 years or older, drawn from general populations, and followed for at least 1 year were included. Relevant, good-quality systematic reviews were also eligible. DATA EXTRACTION: Information on study design, outcomes, and quality were extracted by one researcher and verified by another. An overall rating of the quality of evidence was assigned by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: 127 observational studies, 22 RCTs, and 16 systematic reviews were reviewed in the areas of nutritional factors; medical factors and medications; social, economic, or behavioral factors; toxic environmental exposures; and genetics. Few of the factors had sufficient evidence to support an association with cognitive decline. On the basis of observational studies, evidence that supported the benefits of selected nutritional factors or cognitive, physical, or other leisure activities was limited. Current tobacco use, the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 genotype, and certain medical conditions were associated with increased risk. One RCT found a small, sustained benefit from cognitive training (high quality of evidence) and a small RCT reported that physical exercise helps to maintain cognitive function. LIMITATIONS: The categorization and definition of exposures were heterogeneous. Few studies were designed a priori to assess associations between specific exposures and cognitive decline. The review included only English-language studies, prioritized categorical outcomes, and excluded small studies. CONCLUSION: Few potentially beneficial factors were identified from the evidence on risk or protective factors associated with cognitive decline, but the overall quality of the evidence was low.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Ultrasound (US)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been proposed for noninvasive treatment of neuropathic pain and has been investigated in in-vivo studies. However, ultrasound has important limitations regarding treatment guidance and temperature monitoring. Magnetic resonance (MR)-imaging guidance may overcome these limitations and MR-guided HIFU (MR-HIFU) has been used successfully for other clinical indications. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing 3D MR neurography to identify and guide ablation of peripheral nerves using a clinical MR-HIFU system. METHODS: Volumetric MR-HIFU was used to induce lesions in the peripheral nerves of the lower limbs in three pigs. Diffusion-prep MR neurography and T1-weighted images were utilized to identify the target, plan treatment and immediate post-treatment evaluation. For each treatment, one 8 or 12 mm diameter treatment cell was used (sonication duration 20 s and 36 s, power 160-300 W). Peripheral nerves were extracted {\textless} 3 hours after treatment. Ablation dimensions were calculated from thermal maps, post-contrast MRI and macroscopy. Histological analysis included standard H{\&}E staining, Masson's trichrome and toluidine blue staining. RESULTS: All targeted peripheral nerves were identifiable on MR neurography and T1-weighted images and could be accurately ablated with a single exposure of focused ultrasound, with peak temperatures of 60.3 to 85.7°C. The lesion dimensions as measured on MR neurography were similar to the lesion dimensions as measured on CE-T1, thermal dose maps, and macroscopy. Histology indicated major hyperacute peripheral nerve damage, mostly confined to the location targeted for ablation. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that targeted peripheral nerve ablation is feasible with MR-HIFU. Diffusion-prep 3D MR neurography has potential for guiding therapy procedures where either nerve targeting or avoidance is desired, and may also have potential for post-treatment verification of thermal lesions without contrast injection.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Neurovascular compression (NVC) of the trigeminal nerve is associated with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), but also occurs in many patients without facial pain. This study is designed to identify anatomical characteristics of NVC associated with TN. METHODS: Thirty patients with Type 1 TN (intermittent shocklike pain) and 15 patients without facial pain underwent imaging for analysis of 30 trigeminal nerves ipsilateral to TN symptoms, 30 contralateral to TN symptoms, and 30 in asymptomatic patients. Patients underwent 3-T MR imaging including balanced fast-field echo and MR angiography. Images were fused and reconstructed into virtual cisternoscopy images that were evaluated to determine the presence and degree of NVC. Reconstructed coronal images were used to measure nerve diameter and crosssectional area. RESULTS: The incidence of arterial NVC in asymptomatic nerves, nerves contralateral to TN symptoms, and nerves ipsilateral to TN symptoms was 17{\%}, 43{\%}, and 57{\%}, respectively. The difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic nerves was significant regarding the presence of NVC, nerve distortion, and the site of compression (p {\textless} 0.001, Fisher exact test). The most significant predictors of TN were compression of the proximal nerve (odds ratio 10.4) and nerve indentation or displacement (odds ratio 4.3). There was a tendency for the development of increasingly severe nerve compression with more advanced patient age across all groups. Decreased nerve size was observed in patients with TN but did not correlate with the presence or extent of NVC. CONCLUSIONS: Trigeminal NVC occurs in asymptomatic patients but is more severe and more proximal in patients with TN. This information may help identify patients who are likely to benefit from microvascular decompression},

abstract = {The ability to detect and respond appropriately to aversive stimuli is essential for all organisms, from fruit flies to humans. This suggests the existence of a core neural network which mediates aversion-related processing. Human imaging studies on aversion have highlighted the involvement of various cortical regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, while animal studies have focused largely on subcortical regions like the periaqueductal gray and hypothalamus. However, whether and how these regions form a core neural network of aversion remains unclear. To help determine this, a translational cross-species investigation in humans (i.e., meta-analysis) and other animals (i.e., systematic review of functional neuroanatomy) was performed. Our results highlighted the recruitment of the anterior cingulate cortex, the anterior insula, and the amygdala as well as other subcortical (e.g., thalamus, midbrain) and cortical (e.g., orbitofrontal) regions in both animals and humans. Importantly, involvement of these regions remained independent of sensory modality. This study provides evidence for a core neural network mediating aversion in both animals and humans. This not only contributes to our understanding of the trans-species neural correlates of aversion but may also carry important implications for psychiatric disorders where abnormal aversive behavior can often be observed.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized and observational cohorts. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of patients with and without workers' compensation who had surgical and nonoperative treatment for a lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies have examined the association between worker's compensation and outcomes of surgical and nonoperative treatment. METHODS: Patients with at least 6 weeks of sciatica and a lumbar IDH were enrolled in either a randomized trial or observational cohort at 13 US spine centers. Patients were categorized as workers' compensation or nonworkers' compensation based on baseline disability compensation and work status. Treatment was usual nonoperative care or surgical discectomy. Outcomes included pain, functional impairment, satisfaction and work/disability status at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: Combining randomized and observational cohorts, 113 patients with workers' compensation and 811 patients without were followed for 2 years. There were significant improvements in pain, function, and satisfaction with both surgical and nonoperative treatment in both groups. In the nonworkers' compensation group, there was a clinically and statistically significant advantage for surgery at 3 months that remained significant at 2 years. However, in the workers' compensation group, the benefit of surgery diminished with time; at 2 years no significant advantage was seen for surgery in any outcome (treatment difference for SF-36 bodily pain [-5.9; 95{\%} CI: -16.7-4.9] and physical function [5.0; 95{\%} CI: -4.9-15]). Surgical treatment was not associated with better work or disability outcomes in either group. CONCLUSION: Patients with a lumbar IDH improved substantially with both surgical and nonoperative treatment. However, there was no added benefit associated with surgical treatment for patients with workers' compensation at 2 years while those in the nonworkers' compensation group had significantly greater improvement with surgical treatment},

abstract = {Decades of research on the neural code underlying spatial navigation have re-vealed a diverse set of neural response properties. The Entorhinal Cortex (EC) of the mammalian brain contains a rich set of spatial correlates, including grid cells which encode space using tessellating patterns. However, the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations remain largely mysterious. As a new way to understand these neural representations, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform navigation tasks in 2D arenas based on veloc-ity inputs. Surprisingly, we find that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies. To-gether, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.},

abstract = {1. To better characterize temporal and spatial mechanisms involved in the coding of prolonged nociceptive stimuli in the spinal cord, the responses of dorsal horn wide dynamic range (WDR) and nociceptive-specific (NS) neurons to prolonged, repetitive noxious heat stimuli (45-49 degrees C) were examined in unanesthetized, spinal cord transected rats. To relate these neuronal responses to conscious dimensions of pain, human subjects were presented with identical types of prolonged, repetitive stimuli, so that psychophysical ratings of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness could be compared with the magnitudes and temporal features of the responses of NS and WDR neurons. 2. WDR neurons exhibited high rates of impulse discharge throughout 45 min of repetitive nociceptive stimulation, with only partial reduction (31{\%} decrease from peak rates) occurring after 2 min of stimulation. In sharp contrast, NS neurons stimulated under the same conditions displayed substantial reduction of firing (73{\%} decrease from peak rates) after a brief, initial period of activity that occurred within 2 min after onset of stimulation. Psychophysical ratings of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness, like the responses of WDR neurons, did not decrease substantially from initial levels during 7 min of painful stimulation. Furthermore, these ratings remained at high levels during time periods where the impulse frequencies of NS neurons were only at 27{\%} of maximal levels. 3. Graded nociceptive stimuli were employed to characterize the ability of WDR neurons to encode nociceptive intensity over long durations of repetitive stimulation and to delineate further the relationship between WDR and psychophysical responses. Both WDR discharge frequencies and psychophysical ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness increased in a monotonic manner to graded increases in stimulus temperatures. 4. These results indicate that pain does not decrease substantially during the course of prolonged, repetitive nociceptive stimulation. The fact that the responses of NS neurons decline significantly, whereas both WDR and psychophysical responses do not, suggests that WDR neurons alone are sufficient to evoke both sensory intensity and affective responses to prolonged pain. Furthermore, because subjects could localize and qualitatively describe pain at times when responses of NS neurons were minimal, WDR neurons alone can encode some spatial and qualitative aspects of pain.},

abstract = {The dissociation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and permanent disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), termed the clinicoradiological paradox, can primarily be attributed to the lack of specificity of conventional, relaxivity-based MRI measurements in detecting axonal damage, the primary pathological correlate of long-term impairment in MS. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in specifically detecting axonal damage and demyelination in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To quantify the specificity of DTI in detecting axonal injury, in vivo DTI maps from the spinal cords of mice with EAE and quantitative histological maps were both registered to a common space. A pixelwise correlation analysis between DTI parameters, histological metrics, and EAE scores revealed a significant correlation between the water diffusion parallel to the white matter fibers, or axial diffusivity, and EAE score. Furthermore, axial diffusivity was the primary correlate of quantitative staining for neurofilaments (SMI31), markers of axonal integrity. Both axial diffusivity and neurofilament staining were decreased throughout the entire white matter, not solely within the demyelinated lesions seen in EAE. In contrast, although anisotropy was significantly correlated with EAE score, it was not correlated with axonal damage. The results demonstrate a strong, quantitative relationship between axial diffusivity and axonal damage and show that anisotropy is not specific for axonal damage after inflammatory demyelination},

abstract = {It is well established that there is individual variability in pain and temperature sensitivity. Functional brain imaging studies have found that interindividual heat pain variability correlates with brain activity in sensory and pain modulation areas. Thus, it is possible that these individual differences are associated with variability in gray matter thickness of cortical regions involved in thermoreception and pain. To test this, we investigated the relationship between thermal thresholds and cortical thickness in 80 healthy subjects. Subjects underwent a psychophysical session to determine their cool detection (CD), warm detection (WD), cold pain (CP), and heat pain (HP) threshold. A high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scan was acquired for each subject. We correlated each threshold measure to cortical thickness of regions associated with thermoreception and pain. The mean (± SD) thresholds were 30.7 °C (± 0.8) for CD, 33.8 °C (± 0.7) for WD, 11.7 °C (± 9.7) for CP, and 45.3 °C (± 2.8) for HP. The brain gray matter analysis revealed a strong correlation between greater thermal and pain sensitivity and cortical thickening of the primary somatosensory cortex. Additionally, greater sensitivity to cool stimuli correlated with cortical thickening in the paracentral lobule, and greater WD correlated with cortical thinning in the anterior midcingulate cortex. We also found that greater HP sensitivity correlated with thickening in the posterior midcingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. These cortical gray matter correlates of thermal and pain sensitivity provide a neural basis for individual differences in thermal sensitivity.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging provides a way of assessing the asymmetry of white matter (WM) connectivity, the degree of anisotropic diffusion within a given voxel being a marker of coherently bundled myelinated fibers. Voxel-based statistical analysis was performed on fractional anisotropy (FA) images of 42 right- and 40 left-handers, to assess differences in underlying WM anisotropy and FA asymmetry across the whole brain. Right-handers show greater anisotropy than left-handers in the uncinate fasciculus (UF) within the limbic lobe, and WM underlying prefrontal cortex, medial and inferior frontal gyri. Significantly greater leftward FA asymmetry in cerebellum posterior lobe is seen in left- than right-handers, and males show significantly greater rightward (right-greater-than-left) FA asymmetry in regions of middle occipital lobe, medial temporal gyrus, and a region of the superior longitudinal fasciculus underlying the supramarginal gyrus. Leftward (left-greater-than-right) anisotropy is found in regions of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), UF, and WM underlying pars triangularis in both handedness groups, with right-handers alone showing additional leftward FA asymmetry along the length of the superior temporal gyrus. Overall results indicate that although both handedness groups show anisotropy in similar WM regions, greater anisotropy is observed in right-handers compared with left-handers. The largest differences in FA asymmetry are found between males and females, suggesting a greater effect of sex than handedness on FA asymmetry.},

abstract = {Structural and functional interconnections of the bilateral central vestibular network have not yet been completely delineated. This includes both ipsilateral and contralateral pathways and crossing sites on the way from the vestibular nuclei via the thalamic relay stations to multiple "vestibular cortex" areas. This study investigated "vestibular" connectivity in the living human brain in between the vestibular nuclei and the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) by combined structural and functional connectivity mapping using diffusion tensor imaging and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging in 24 healthy right-handed volunteers. We observed a congruent functional and structural link between the vestibular nuclei and the ipsilateral and contralateral PIVC. Five separate and distinct vestibular pathways were identified: three run ipsilaterally, while the two others cross either in the pons or the midbrain. Two of the ipsilateral projections run through the posterolateral or paramedian thalamic subnuclei, while the third bypasses the thalamus to reach the inferior part of the insular cortex directly. Both contralateral pathways travel through the posterolateral thalamus. At the cortical level, the PIVC regions of both hemispheres with a right hemispherical dominance are interconnected transcallosally through the antero-caudal splenium. The above-described bilateral vestibular circuitry in its entirety takes the form of a structure of a rope ladder extending from the brainstem to the cortex with three crossings in the brainstem (vestibular nuclei, pons, midbrain), none at thalamic level and a fourth cortical crossing through the splenium of the corpus callosum.},

abstract = {This paper applies and evaluates an automatic mutual information-based registration algorithm across a broad spectrum of multimodal volume data sets. The algorithm requires little or no pre-processing, minimal user input and easily implements either affine, i.e. linear or thin-plate spline (TPS) warped registrations. We have evaluated the algorithm in phantom studies as well as in selected cases where few other algorithms could perform as well, if at all, to demonstrate the value of this new method. Pairs of multimodal gray-scale volume data sets were registered by iteratively changing registration parameters to maximize mutual information. Quantitative registration errors were assessed in registrations of a thorax phantom using PET/CT and in the National Library of Medicine's Visible Male using MRI T2-/T1-weighted acquisitions. Registrations of diverse clinical data sets were demonstrated including rotate-translate mapping of PET/MRI brain scans with significant missing data, full affine mapping of thoracic PET/CT and rotate-translate mapping of abdominal SPECT/CT. A five-point thin-plate spline (TPS) warped registration of thoracic PET/CT is also demonstrated. The registration algorithm converged in times ranging between 3.5 and 31 min for affine clinical registrations and 57 min for TPS warping. Mean error vector lengths for rotate-translate registrations were measured to be subvoxel in phantoms. More importantly the rotate-translate algorithm performs well even with missing data. The demonstrated clinical fusions are qualitatively excellent at all levels. We conclude that such automatic, rapid, robust algorithms significantly increase the likelihood that multimodality registrations will be routinely used to aid clinical diagnoses and post-therapeutic assessment in the near future.},

abstract = {Neurovascular compression syndromes are usually caused by arteries that directly contact the cisternal portion of a cranial nerve. Not all cases of neurovascular contact are clinically symptomatic. The transition zone between the central and peripheral myelin is the most vulnerable region for symptomatic neurovascular compression syndromes. Trigeminal neuralgia (cranial nerve V) has an incidence of 4-20/100,000, a transition zone of 4 mm, with symptomatic neurovascular compression typically proximal. Hemifacial spasm (cranial nerve VII) has an incidence of 1/100,000, a transition zone of 2.5 mm, with symptomatic neurovascular compression typically proximal. Vestibular paroxysmia (cranial nerve VIII) has an unknown incidence, a transition zone of 11 mm, with symptomatic neurovascular compression typically at the internal auditory canal. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (cranial nerve IX) has an incidence of 0.5/100,000, a transition zone of 1.5 mm, with symptomatic neurovascular compression typically proximal. The transition zone overlaps the root entry zone close to the brain stem in cranial nerves V, VII, and IX, yet it is more distal and does not overlap the root entry zone in cranial nerve VIII. Although symptomatic neurovascular compression syndromes may also occur if the neurovascular contact is outside the transition zone, symptomatic neurovascular compression syndromes are more common if the neurovascular contact occurs at the transition zone or central myelin section, in particular when associated with nerve displacement and atrophy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this pilot investigation was to identify structural brain differences in older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP) as compared with pain-free individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, case-control. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen cognitively intact older adults, eight with CLBP and eight pain-free; excluded if with psychiatric or neurological disorders, substance abuse, opioid use, diabetes mellitus, and/or hypertension. METHODS: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tests of neuropsychological performance (digit span, digit symbol substitution, letter-number sequencing, trail making) were administered to all participants. Gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid, and corpus callosum (CC) volumes were measured as a percentage of total supratentorial intracranial volume. Voxel-based morphometry analysis of GM and WM assessed regional differences. RESULTS: Between-groups analysis revealed a non-significant trend toward decreased middle CC volume in the CLBP group (1.43E-03 +/- 2.67E-04, 1.63E-03 +/- 2.00E-04: P = 0.09). Regional analysis in the CLBP group demonstrated significantly decreased GM volume (P {\textless} 0.001) in the posterior parietal cortex and middle cingulate WM volume (P {\textless} 0.001) of the left hemisphere. CLBP participants performed significantly worse on digit span forward (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with CLBP have structural brain changes in the middle CC, middle cingulate WM, and the GM of the posterior parietal cortex as well as impaired attention and mental flexibility. Additional investigation is needed to corroborate and extend these findings and more clearly elucidate their relationship to physical function and the risk of disability},

abstract = {Physical injury or compression of the root, dorsal root ganglion, or peripheral sensory axon leads to well-defined changes in biology and function. Behaviorally, humans report ongoing painful dysesthesias and aberrations in function, such that an otherwise innocuous stimulus will yield a pain report. These behavioral reports are believed to reflect the underlying changes in nerve function after injury, wherein increased spontaneous activity arises from the neuroma and dorsal root ganglion and spinal changes increase the response of spinal projection neurons. These pain states are distinct from those associated with tissue injury and pose particular problems in management. To provide for developing an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these pain states and to promote development of therapeutic agents, preclinical models involving section, compression, and constriction of the peripheral nerve or compression of the dorsal root ganglion have been developed. These models give rise to behaviors, which parallel those observed in the human after nerve injury. The present review considers these models and their application},

abstract = {The dorsal horn of the spinal cord is the location of the first synapse in pain pathways, and as such, offers a very powerful target for regulation of nociceptive transmission by both local segmental and supraspinal mechanisms. Descending control of spinal nociception originates from many brain regions and plays a critical role in determining the experience of both acute and chronic pain. The earlier concept of descending control as an "analgesia system" is now being replaced with a more nuanced model in which pain input is prioritized relative to other competing behavioral needs and homeostatic demands. Descending control arises from a number of supraspinal sites, including the midline periaqueductal gray-rostral ventromedial medulla (PAG-RVM) system, and the more lateral and caudal dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt) and ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Inhibitory control from the PAG-RVM system preferentially suppresses nociceptive inputs mediated by C-fibers, preserving sensory-discriminative information conveyed by more rapidly conducting A-fibers. Analysis of the circuitry within the RVM reveals that the neural basis for bidirectional control from the midline system is two populations of neurons, ON-cells and OFF-cells, that are differentially recruited by higher structures important in fear, illness and psychological stress to enhance or inhibit pain. Dynamic shifts in the balance between pain inhibiting and facilitating outflows from the brainstem play a role in setting the gain of nociceptive processing as dictated by behavioral priorities, but are also likely to contribute to pathological pain states.},

abstract = {Objectives: To analyze our own functional results to delineate a critical vestibular schwannoma size for middle cranial fossa (MCF) surgery with the best possible outcome. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Academic tertiary referral center. Methods: Tumors were divided into intracanalicular, tumors 1 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 15 mm in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Patients were evaluated at 2 months, 1 year, and 5 years after surgery. Results: At 1 year, House-Brackmann score of I or II was obtained in 100{\%} of intracanalicular and in 96{\%}, 86{\%}, and 85{\%} with tumors up to 5, 10, and 15 mm in the CPA, respectively. Class I hearing was postoperatively preserved in 61{\%}, 41{\%}, 29{\%}, and 20{\%}, and measurable word recognition in 67{\%}, 51{\%}, 35{\%}, and 21{\%} of patients, respectively. Conclusion: The outcome is predominantly a function of tumor size, and these changes influence MCF surgery at an earlier stage than in the translabyrinthine or retrosigmoid approach. For the facial nerve, there is a cutoff at 5-mm extracanalicular extension. Also, chances for successful hearing preservation decrease rapidly with size, and in tumors beyond 1.5 cm are below 20{\%}. Consequently, although an expectant policy with small tumors may be reasonable in some instances, it is not so for MCF candidates.},

abstract = {Tract-based analysis from DTI has become a widely employed procedure to study the white matter of the brain and its alterations in neurological and neurosurgical pathologies. Automatic tractography selection methods, where a subset of detected tracts corresponding to a specific white matter structure are selected, are a key component of the DTI processing pipeline. Using automatic tractography selection, repeatable results free of intra and inter-expert variability can be obtained rapidly, without the need for cumbersome manual segmentation. Many of the current approaches for automatic tractography selection rely on a previous registration procedure using an atlas; hence, these methods are likely very sensitive to the accuracy of the registration. In this paper we show that the performance of the registration step is critical to the overall result. This effect can in turn affect the calculation of scalar parameters derived subsequently from the selected tracts and often used in clinical practice; we show that such errors may be comparable in magnitude to the subtle differences found in clinical studies to differentiate between healthy and pathological. As an alternative, we propose a tractography selection method based on the use of geometrical constraints specific for each fiber bundle. Our experimental results show that the approach proposed performs with increased robustness and accuracy with respect to other approaches in the literature, particularly in the presence of imperfect registration.},

abstract = {In humans, mutations of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins (PS) 1 and 2 are associated with amyloid deposition, brain structural change and cognitive decline, like in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mice expressing these proteins have illuminated neurodegenerative disease processes but, unlike in humans, quantitative imaging has been little used to systematically determine their effects, or those of normal aging, on brain structure in vivo. Accordingly, we investigated wildtype (WT) and TASTPM mice (expressing human APP(695(K595N, M596L)) x PS1(M146V)) longitudinally using MRI. Automated global and local image registration, allied to a standard digital atlas, provided pairwise segmentation of 13 brain regions. We found the mature mouse brain, unlike in humans, enlarges significantly from 6-14 months old (WT 3.8+/-1.7{\%}, mean+/-SD, P{\textless}0.0001). Significant changes were also seen in other WT brain regions, providing an anatomical benchmark for comparing other mouse strains and models of brain disorder. In TASTPM, progressive amyloidosis and astrogliosis, detected immunohistochemically, reflected even larger whole brain changes (5.1+/-1.4{\%}, P{\textless}0.0001, transgenexage interaction P=0.0311). Normalising regional volumes to whole brain measurements revealed significant, prolonged, WT-TASTPM volume differences, suggesting transgene effects establish at {\textless}6 months old of age in most regions. As in humans, gray matter-rich regions decline with age (e.g. thalamus, cerebral cortex and caudoputamen); ventricles and white matter (corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, fornix system) increase; in TASTPMs such trends often varied significantly from WT (especially hippocampus). The pervasive, age-related structural changes between WT and AD transgenic mice (and mouse and human) suggest subtle but fundamental species differences and AD transgene effects.},

abstract = {MRI tractography is the mapping of neural fiber pathways based on diffusion MRI of tissue diffusion anisotropy. Tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) cannot directly image multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. To address this limitation, diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) and related methods were developed to image complex distributions of intravoxel fiber orientation. Here we demonstrate that tractography based on DSI has the capacity to image crossing fibers in neural tissue. DSI was performed in formalin-fixed brains of adult macaque and in the brains of healthy human subjects. Fiber tract solutions were constructed by a streamline procedure, following directions of maximum diffusion at every point, and analyzed in an interactive visualization environment (TrackVis). We report that DSI tractography accurately shows the known anatomic fiber crossings in optic chiasm, centrum semiovale, and brainstem; fiber intersections in gray matter, including cerebellar folia and the caudate nucleus; and radial fiber architecture in cerebral cortex. In contrast, none of these examples of fiber crossing and complex structure was identified by DTI analysis of the same data sets. These findings indicate that DSI tractography is able to image crossing fibers in neural tissue, an essential step toward non-invasive imaging of connectional neuroanatomy.},

abstract = {Patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) perform poorly in neuropsychological tests of cognitive function. These deficits might be related to dysfunction in brain networks that support pain and cognition, due to the impact of chronic pain and its related emotional processes on cognitive ability. We therefore tested whether patients with TMD perform poorly in cognitive and emotion tasks and whether they had abnormal task-evoked brain activity. Seventeen female subjects with nontraumatic TMD and 17 age-matched healthy female subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing counting Stroop tasks comprising neutral words, incongruent numbers, or emotional words, including TMD-specific words. Group differences in task-related brain responses were assessed. Connectivity between 2 pairs of coupled brain regions during the cognitive and emotional tasks (prefrontal-cingulate and amygdala-cingulate) was also examined. The patients had sluggish Stroop reaction times for all Stroop tasks. Furthermore, compared to controls, patients showed increased task-evoked responses in brain areas implicated in attention (eg, lateral prefrontal, inferior parietal), emotional processes (eg, amygdala, pregenual anterior cingulate), motor planning and performance (eg, supplementary and primary motor areas), and activation of the default-mode network (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate). The patients also exhibited decoupling of the normally correlated activity between the prefrontal and cingulate cortices and between the amygdala and cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that the slow behavioral responses in idiopathic TMD may be due to attenuated, slower, and/or unsynchronized recruitment of attention/cognition processing areas. These abnormalities may be due to the salience of chronic pain, which inherently requires attention. Sluggish performance in cognitive and emotional interference tasks in patients with nontraumatic temporomandibular disorder is associated with pronounced and unsynchronized task-evoked fMRI brain responses.},

abstract = {Empathy refers to the ability to perceive and share another person's affective state. Much neuroimaging evidence suggests that observing others' suffering and pain elicits activations of the anterior insular and the anterior cingulate cortices associated with subjective empathetic responses in the observer. However, these observations do not provide causal evidence for the respective roles of anterior insular and anterior cingulate cortices in empathetic pain. Therefore, whether these regions are 'necessary' for empathetic pain remains unknown. Herein, we examined the perception of others' pain in patients with anterior insular cortex or anterior cingulate cortex lesions whose locations matched with the anterior insular cortex or anterior cingulate cortex clusters identified by a meta-analysis on neuroimaging studies of empathetic pain perception. Patients with focal anterior insular cortex lesions displayed decreased discrimination accuracy and prolonged reaction time when processing others' pain explicitly and lacked a typical interference effect of empathetic pain on the performance of a pain-irrelevant task. In contrast, these deficits were not observed in patients with anterior cingulate cortex lesions. These findings reveal that only discrete anterior insular cortex lesions, but not anterior cingulate cortex lesions, result in deficits in explicit and implicit pain perception, supporting a critical role of anterior insular cortex in empathetic pain processing. Our findings have implications for a wide range of neuropsychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent deficits in higher-level social functioning.},

abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

abstract = {Functional neuronavigation allows intraoperative visualization of cortical eloquent brain areas. Major white matter tracts, such as the pyramidal tract, can be delineated by diffusion-tensor-imaging based fiber tracking. These tractography data were integrated into 3-D datasets applied for neuronavigation by rigid registration of the diffusion images with standard anatomical image data so that their course could be superimposed onto the surgical field during resection of gliomas. Intraoperative high-field magnetic resonance imaging was used to compensate for the effects of brain shift, which amounted up to 8 mm. Despite image distortion of echo planar images, which was identified by non-linear registration techniques, navigation was reliable. In none of the 19 patients new postoperative neurological deficits were encountered. Intraoperative visualization of major white matter tracts allows save resection of gliomas near eloquent brain areas. A possible shifting of the pyramidal tract has to be taken into account after major tumor parts are resected},

abstract = {The cingulate cortex is a structurally heterogeneous brain region involved in emotional, cognitive and motor tasks. With the aim of identifying which behavioral domains are associated with the activation of the cingulate cortex, we performed a structure based-meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which assesses statistical significant convergence of neuroimaging studies using the BrainMap database. To map the meta-analytic coactivation maps of the cingulate cortex (MACM), we subdivided the parenchyma along the rostro-caudal axis in 12 bilateral equispaced ROIs. ROIs were not chosen according to previously suggested subdivisions, as to obtain a completely data-driven result. Studies were included with one or more activation coordinates in at least one of the 12 pre-defined ROIs. The meta-analytic connectivity profile and behavioral domains profiles were identified for each ROI. Cluster analysis was then performed on the MACM and behavioral domains to group together ROIs with similar profiles. The results showed that the cingulate cortex can be divided in three clusters according to the MACM parcellation and in four according to the behavioral domain-based parcellation. In addition, a behavioral-domain based meta-analysis was conducted and the spatial consistency of functional connectivity patterns across different domain-related ALE results was evaluated by computing probabilistic maps. These maps identified some portions of the cingulate cortex as involved in several tasks. Our results showed the existence of a more specific functional characterization of some portions of the cingulate cortex but also a great multifunctionality of others. By analyzing a large number of studies, structure based meta-analysis can greatly contribute to new insights in the functional significance of brain activations and in the role of specific brain areas in behavior.},

abstract = {OBJECT: There is continuous interest in the monitoring of language function during tumor resection around the frontotemporal regions of the dominant hemisphere. The aim of this study was to visualize language-related subcortical connections, such as the arcuate fasciculus (AF) by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with brain lesions adjacent to the AF in the frontotemporal regions of the dominant hemisphere were studied. The AF tractography was accomplished by placing initiation and termination sites (seed and target points) in the frontal and temporal regions, which were functionally identified by using functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging in conjunction with a verb generation task and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with a reading task. The combination of fMR imaging and MEG data clearly demonstrated the hemispheric dominance of language functions, which was confirmed by an intracranial amobarbital test (Wada procedure). In all 22 patients, the authors were able to consistently visualize the AF by DT imaging-based tractography, using the functionally identified seed and target points and a fractional anisotropy value of 0.16. In two of 22 cases investigated, the functional information, including the results of AF tractography, fMR imaging, and MEG, was imported to a neuronavigation system and was validated by bipolar electric stimulation of the cortical and subcortical areas during awake surgery. The cortical stimulation to the gyrus that included the area of activation identified in fMR imaging with the language task evoked speech arrest, while the subcortical stimulation close to the AF reproducibly caused paranomia without speech arrest. Postoperative AF tractography showed that the distances between the stimulus points and the AF were within 6 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of these techniques facilitated accurate identification of the location of the AF and verification of the language fibers},

abstract = {The nonhuman primate brain study provides important supplemental means for human brain exploration since the two species share close anatomical and functional similarities. MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in human brain has revealed exquisite details of brain structures especially in the brain white matter. However, most previous monkey brain DTI results lack the spatial resolution in comparison to the conventional tracing and postmortem imaging methods, especially when it is acquired in commonly available human MRI scanners of field strength of 3 T or lower. To meet the increasing demands for nonhuman primate DTI studies, we proposed an in vivo high-resolution monkey DTI acquisition protocol that is practically feasible and combined it with an improved postprocessing procedure for a 3-T human scanner. The acquisition protocol, susceptibility distortion correction method with phase reversal acquisition, and postprocessing steps were proved to be effective in our study of rhesus monkeys. Results from diffusion tensor estimations and fiber tractography at 1x1x1 mm(3) resolution were found to be comparable to previous ex vivo DTI studies with much longer acquisition times. Effects of image resolution were evaluated and it was confirmed that the partial volume effect due to the larger voxel size in low-resolution data biased the diffusion tensor estimation and produced erroneous fiber tractography. Our results suggest that in vivo high-resolution monkey brain DTI can be achieved within practical time, which allows accurate diffusion tensor estimation and fiber tractography in monkey brains, so that the complex anatomical structures within many small but important anatomic structures can be delineated},

abstract = {A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or an object part. We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and white matter tractography (WMT) are promising techniques for estimating the course, extent, and connectivity patterns of the white matter (WM) structures in the human brain. In this study, we investigated the ability of DTI and WMT to visualize white matter tract involvement for the preoperative surgical planning and postoperative assessment of brainstem lesions. METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative DTI data (echo-planar, 1.5T) were retrospectively analyzed in 10 patients with brainstem lesions (3 diffuse, 7 focal). WMT applying a tensor deflection algorithm was used to reconstruct WM tracts adjacent to the lesions. Reconstructed tracts included corticospinal tracts and medial lemnisci. The clinical and imaging follow-up data were also compared and analyzed. FINDINGS: WMT revealed a series of tract alteration patterns including deviation, deformation, infiltration, and apparent tract interruption. WMT reconstructions showed that the major WM tracts were preserved during surgery and improved in position and appearance postoperatively. These findings correlated with the improvement or preservation of neurological function as determined by clinical assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the information provided by conventional MR imaging, DTI and WMT provided superior quantification and visualization of lesion involvement in eloquent fibre tracts of the brainstem. Moreover, DTI and WMT were found to be beneficial for white matter recognition in the neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment of brainstem lesions},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the function of trigeminal nerve before and after microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia. BACKGROUND: To date there is no direct evidence that microvascular decompression of the trigeminal root restores normal conduction in the nerve. METHODS: The authors examined 10 patients with trigeminal neuralgia in whom preoperative MRI and MR angiography demonstrated neurovascular contact. During microvascular decompression, the trigeminal nerve was monitored by recording early scalp trigeminal evoked potentials immediately before, during, and after decompression. Direct recordings from the root entry zone were also performed. RESULTS: In all patients preoperative scalp evoked potentials showed impaired conduction of the trigeminal root. Microvascular decompression was associated with immediate recovery of conduction in seven patients, demonstrated by both scalp evoked potentials and direct root recordings. All 10 patients were pain free postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in trigeminal neuralgia following microvascular decompression is often associated with normalization of neurophysiologic data, suggesting recovery of nerve function. Rapid electrophysiologic recovery and pain relief following microvascular decompression argue that neither phenomenon is linked to remyelination. It is possible that the trigeminal evoked potentials might predict an effective microvascular decompression},

A geographically based subgroup of 196 patients representing 90{\%} of Middlesex County MS patients as well as a group of 197 patients seen from onset of disease were separately analysed. The clinical course was progressive from onset in 33{\%} of the total population and in 28{\%} of the Middlesex County subgroup.

METHODS: Fourteen definite-ALS patients and 12 age-matched controls underwent whole brain DTI on a 3T scanner. Mean-diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were obtained bilaterally from the basal ganglia and thalamus in the regions-of-interest (ROIs). RESULTS: The MD was significantly higher (P {\textless} .02) in basal ganglia and thalamus in patients with ALS compared with controls. Correspondingly, the FA was significantly lower (P {\textless} .02) in these structures, except in caudate (P = .04) and putamen (P = .06) in patients compared with controls. There were mild to strong correlations (r = .3-.7) between the DTI measures of basal ganglia and finger-tap, foot-tap, and lip-and-tongue movement rate. CONCLUSIONS: The increased MD in basal ganglia and thalamus and decreased FA in globus pallidus and thalamus are indicative of neuronal loss or dysfunction in these structures.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adult-onset schizophrenia has repeatedly been associated with disturbances in the temporal lobes and alterations in cortical folding, which are thought to reflect neurodevelopmental impairment. Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS; onset before 18 years) is considered to involve even more pronounced neurodevelopmental deviance across a wide range of brain structural measures. We hypothesized that overall alteration of cortical folding also applies to EOS, and EOS involves prominent structural aberrations in superior temporal and collateral sulci. METHOD: Magnetic resonance T1 images of 51 patients with EOS and 59 healthy participants were investigated. A fully automated method was applied to the images to extract, label, and measure the sulcus area in the whole cortex. Cortical folding was assessed by computing global sulcal indices (the ratio between total sulcal area and total outer cortex area) for each hemisphere and local sulcal indices (the ratio between the area of labeled sulcus and total outer cortex area in the corresponding hemisphere) for superior temporal and collateral sulci. RESULTS: Relative to healthy individuals, patients with EOS had significantly lower global sulcal indices in both hemispheres and a lower local sulcal index in the left collateral sulcus. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced hemispheric sulcation appears to be a feature of schizophrenia, irrespective of age at onset. Structural aberration involving the left collateral sulcus may contribute to neurobiological substrate of EOS},

abstract = {Clinical, genetic, and pathological findings suggest a close relationship between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We studied the patterns of cortical atrophy across the spectrum between ALS and ALS-FTD. A surface-based morphometry analysis based on an age- and sex-matched sample of 81 ALS patients and 62 healthy control subjects (HC) was conducted. In addition, we used an age-matched subsample of 57 ALS patients and 31 HC to compare cortical thickness between 3 groups of neuropsychologically characterized ALS patients: (1) cognitively unimpaired; (2) cognitively impaired; and (3) ALS-FTD patients. Compared with HC, the entire sample of patients demonstrated cortical thinning in the bilateral precentral gyrus, right precuneus, and right frontal and temporal lobes. ALS-FTD patients showed cortical thinning in regions including the frontal and temporal gyri and the posterior cingulate cortex. Cognitively impaired ALS patients showed cortical thinning in regions largely overlapping with those found in ALS-FTD, but changes were less widespread. In conclusion, the cognitive status of ALS subjects is associated with different patterns of cortical atrophy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We undertook this anatomic study of the insula to investigate its vasculature, morphological features, and surrounding cortical relationships. METHODS: Under magnification of x2 to x32, 53 formalin-fixed, adult cadaver hemispheres were dissected. Overlying opercular landmarks were identified and used as guides to portions of the deeper insula. RESULTS: The insula has a complex venous system; 50 (94.3{\%}) hemispheres exhibited a combination of superficial and deep venous connections. The venous connections divide the insular cortex into the following three anatomic zones, with some overlap: subapical region (insular pole), anterior lobe, and posterior lobe. Arterial contributions to the insula originated entirely from the middle cerebral artery, predominantly via the superior division. Thirty-six (67.9{\%}) specimens exhibited a dedicated terminal vessel to the insula; in 34 of these (94.4{\%}), this terminal vessel arose from the middle cerebral artery branch to the central sulcus. There was never more than one terminal vessel in each insular cortex. CONCLUSION: Historically, it has been reported that the insula drains primarily via the deep middle cerebral vein (DMCV). We found more complex (typically both superficial and deep) venous connections. In most specimens, the DMCV exhibited a direct venous connection to only a portion of the insular cortex. The deep drainage connections of the insula and the vessels that form the DMCV suggest that the DMCV drains primarily the lateral lenticular veins and secondarily the insula. Arterial contributions to the insula tended to be centered around the central insular sulcus, independent of the location of the middle cerebral artery bifurcation. Although the insular vascular anatomic features showed great variability, the anatomic and structural relationships described in this dissection series should facilitate safe surgical and endovascular interventions.},

abstract = {It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear. In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle. We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant, sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.},

abstract = {Pain perception is a multidimensional phenomenon, derived from sensory, affective, cognitive-evaluative and homeostatic information. Neuroimaging studies of pain perception have investigated the role of primary somatosensory cortex (SI); however, they have typically failed to demonstrate the expected somatotopy. An alternative network for the sensory component of pain has been proposed, involving a temperature and pain-specific nucleus of the thalamus (VMpo) and its projections to dorsal posterior insula (dpIns). According to this hypothesis, projections to the insula should be arranged somatotopically. In order to test for the presence of somatotopy in the operculo-insular brain region, we delivered moderately painful thermal stimuli to the right face, hand and foot in 14 healthy subjects and recorded brain responses using high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. For each subject, the thermode temperature was adjusted to produce pain ratings of 5 to 6 out of 10, which corresponded to average temperatures for the face, hand and foot of 49.6, 48.5 and 48.5 degrees C, respectively. Examination of mixed effects group activation maps suggested a pain-related somatotopy in the contralateral posterior insula and putamen. Construction of frequency maps revealed that face activation within the posterior insula was anterior to both hand and foot, whilst foot activation was located medially in the circular sulcus. Single subject analysis demonstrated that only coordinates for dpIns activation were significantly dependent on stimulus location (Hotelling's Trace, P = 0.012). Coordinates for face (paired t test, P = 0.004) and hand (P {\textless} 0.001) activity were more lateral than those for foot, whilst face activation was anterior to the foot (P = 0.037). Based on single subject analyses, the average standard space (MNI) coordinates for face, hand and foot activity were (-40,-16,11), (-40,-19,14) and (-35,-21,11) respectively.},

abstract = {Although many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) complain of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), its cause and mechanisms are still debatable. In a multicentre controlled study, we collected 130 patients with MS: 50 patients with TN, 30 patients with trigeminal sensory disturbances other than TN (ongoing pain, dysaesthesia, or hypoesthesia), and 50 control patients. All patients underwent pain assessment, trigeminal reflex testing, and dedicated MRI scans. The MRI scans were imported and normalised into a voxel-based, 3D brainstem model that allows spatial statistical analysis. The onset ages of MS and trigeminal symptoms were significantly older in the TN group. The frequency histogram of onset age for the TN group showed that many patients fell in the age range of classic TN. Most patients in TN and non-TN groups had abnormal trigeminal reflexes. In the TN group, 3D brainstem analysis showed an area of strong probability of lesion (P{\textless}0.0001) centred on the intrapontine trigeminal primary afferents. In the non-TN group, brainstem lesions were more scattered, with the highest probability for lesions (P{\textless}0.001) in a region involving the subnucleus oralis of the spinal trigeminal complex. We conclude that the most likely cause of MS-related TN is a pontine plaque damaging the primary afferents. Nevertheless, in some patients a neurovascular contact may act as a concurring mechanism. The other sensory disturbances, including ongoing pain and dysaesthesia, may arise from damage to the second-order neurons in the spinal trigeminal complex},

In this paper, we propose DIAYN (" Di-versity is All You Need "), a method for learning useful skills without a reward function. Our pro-posed method learns skills by maximizing an in-formation theoretic objective using a maximum entropy policy. On a variety of simulated robotic tasks, we show that this simple objective results in the unsupervised emergence of diverse skills, such as walking and jumping. In a number of reinforcement learning benchmark environments, our method is able to learn a skill that solves the benchmark task despite never receiving the true task reward. In these environments, some of the learned skills correspond to solving the task, and each skill that solves the task does so in a distinct manner. Our results suggest that unsupervised discovery of skills can serve as an effective pre-training mechanism for overcoming challenges of exploration and data efficiency in reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Pain is known to comprise sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects. Despite numerous previous fMRI studies, however, it remains open which spatial distribution of activity is sufficient to encode whether a stimulus is perceived as painful or not. In this study, we analyzed fMRI data from a perceptual decision-making task in which participants were exposed to near-threshold laser pulses. Using multivariate analyses on different spatial scales, we investigated the predictive capacity of fMRI data for decoding whether a stimulus had been perceived as painful. Our analysis yielded a rank order of brain regions: during pain anticipation, activity in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) afforded the most accurate trial-by-trial discrimination between painful and non-painful experiences; whereas during the actual stimulation, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, anterior insula, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and OFC were most discriminative. The most accurate prediction of pain perception from the stimulation period, however, was enabled by the combined activity in pain regions commonly referred to as the 'pain matrix'. Our results demonstrate that the neural representation of (near-threshold) pain is spatially distributed and can be best described at an intermediate spatial scale. In addition to its utility in establishing structure-function mappings, our approach affords trial-by-trial predictions and thus represents a step towards the goal of establishing an objective neuronal marker of pain perception. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The recently introduced Leksell Gamma Knife (LGK) Perfexion is an entirely new system with a different beam geometry compared with the LGK 4C. The new Perfexion system has 192 cobalt-60 sources that are fixed on 8 sectors (each sector has 24 sources). Each sector can be moved independently of the others and can be set to 1 of 5 different positions: 3 positions defining collimator sizes of 4, 8, and 16 mm; an off position (sources are blocked); and a home position. The purpose of this study is to compare the dosimetric characteristics of the GK 4C and the Perfexion models. This comparison is important especially for the treatment of functional disorders when only a single shot with the 4- or 8-mm collimator is used. METHODS: A 160-mm-diameter spherical polystyrene phantom was used for all measurements and calculations. The irradiation geometry consisted of the placement of a single shot at the center of this phantom. Comparisons were made among different dosimetric parameters obtained from calculations performed using Leksell GammaPlan v. 8.0 and measurements performed using film dosimetry. The dosimetric parameters investigated were dose profiles for all collimators in all 3 stereotactic planes (x, y, and z) including the full width at half maximum and the penumbra for each profile, cumulative dose-volume histograms, the volume encompassed by the 50{\%} isodose surface, the mean doses delivered to a defined matrix volume, and relative output factors for all collimator sizes. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between the dosimetric parameters of GK 4C and Perfexion for the 4- and 8-mm collimators. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that consistent treatments of functional disorders will be delivered using either GK 4C or Perfexion},

This algorithm is based on a Monte-Carlo strategy, using regularized particle trajectories to sample the white matter geometry.

The method is based on registering the individual volumes to a model free prediction of what each volume should look like, thereby enabling its use on high b-value data where the contrast is vastly different in different volumes. In addition we show that the linear EC-model commonly used is insufficient for the data used in the present paper (high spatial and angular resolution data acquired with Stejskal-Tanner gradients on a 3T Siemens Verio, a 3T Siemens Connectome Skyra or a 7T Siemens Magnetome scanner) and that a higher order model performs significantly better.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: After most operative treatments for trigeminal neuralgia, long-term tic relief is closely correlated with postoperative numbness in the trigeminal distribution. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is proposed to relieve tic through a nontraumatic mechanism. We investigated the relationship between postoperative trigeminal numbness and tic relief in a large, prospectively followed cohort of patients treated with MVD for typical trigeminal neuralgia. METHODS: Of 1204 patients who underwent MVD for typical tic during a 20-year period, 522 had single MVDs on a single side, had not undergone ablative trigeminal procedures before or after MVD, and were still being followed in 1994. In 1994, patients graded facial numbness using a questionnaire (response rate, 92{\%}) with a 5-point scale. Multivariate Cox and logistic regression methods were used. The analyses were adjusted for the time that had passed between the performance of MVD and the completion of the questionnaire (minimum, 2 yr). RESULTS: Seventeen percent of patients reported some degree of persistent facial numbness. Decompression of a vein at MVD (odds ratio, 2.5) and failure to find compression by the superior cerebellar artery (odds ratio, 2.0) independently predicted postoperative facial numbness, which in turn predicted postoperative burning and aching facial pain (odds ratio, 5.2-5.9). A trend toward worse outcome was noted in patients with numb faces (P = 0.3). Similar findings were noted in subgroups of patients in whom the superior cerebellar artery was decompressed at MVD (n = 381) and in whom a superior cerebellar artery with no vein was found (n = 120). In the latter subgroup, facial numbness (5.8{\%} of patients) significantly predicted worse long-term outcome (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that postoperative trigeminal numbness predicts relief of typical tic after MVD. Trigeminal numbness was related to operative findings at MVD and predicted postoperative burning and aching facial pain. To minimize postoperative facial dysesthesia, trauma to the trigeminal root during MVD should be avoided when possible},

abstract = {Living with unrelenting pain (chronic pain) is maladaptive and is thought to be associated with physiological and psychological modifications, yet there is a lack of knowledge regarding brain elements involved in such conditions. Here, we identify brain regions involved in spontaneous pain of chronic back pain (CBP) in two separate groups of patients (n = 13 and n = 11), and contrast brain activity between spontaneous pain and thermal pain (CBP and healthy subjects, n = 11 each). Continuous ratings of fluctuations of spontaneous pain during functional magnetic resonance imaging were separated into two components: high sustained pain and increasing pain. Sustained high pain of CBP resulted in increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; including rostral anterior cingulate). This mPFC activity was strongly related to intensity of CBP, and the region is known to be involved in negative emotions, response conflict, and detection of unfavorable outcomes, especially in relation to the self. In contrast, the increasing phase of CBP transiently activated brain regions commonly observed for acute pain, best exemplified by the insula, which tightly reflected duration of CBP. When spontaneous pain of CBP was contrasted to thermal stimulation, we observe a double-dissociation between mPFC and insula with the former correlating only to intensity of spontaneous pain and the latter correlating only to pain intensity for thermal stimulation. These findings suggest that subjective spontaneous pain of CBP involves specific spatiotemporal neuronal mechanisms, distinct from those observed for acute experimental pain, implicating a salient role for emotional brain concerning the self.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging investigations in the fields of social neuroscience and neuroeconomics indicate that the anterior insular cortex (AI) is consistently involved in empathy, compassion, and interpersonal phenomena such as fairness and cooperation. These findings suggest that AI plays an important role in social emotions, hereby defined as affective states that arise when we interact with other people and that depend on the social context. After we link the role of AI in social emotions to interoceptive awareness and the representation of current global emotional states, we will present a model suggesting that AI is not only involved in representing current states, but also in predicting emotional states relevant to the self and others. This model also proposes that AI enables us to learn about emotional states as well as about the uncertainty attached to events, and implies that AI plays a dominant role in decision making in complex and uncertain environments. Our review further highlights that dorsal and ventro-central, as well as anterior and posterior subdivisions of AI potentially subserve different functions and guide different aspects of behavioral regulation. We conclude with a section summarizing different routes to understanding other people's actions, feelings and thoughts, emphasizing the notion that the predominant role of AI involves understanding others' feeling and bodily states rather than their action intentions or abstract beliefs.},

abstract = {Normal aging is accompanied by decline in selective cognitive and motor functions. A concurrent decline in regional white matter integrity, detectable with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), potentially contributes to waning function. DTI analysis of white matter loci indicates an anterior-to-posterior gradient distribution of declining fractional anisotropy (FA) and increasing diffusivity with age. Quantitative fiber tracking can be used to determine regional patterns of normal aging of fiber systems and test the functional ramifications of the DTI metrics. Here, we used quantitative fiber tracking to examine age effects on commissural (genu and splenium), bilateral association (cingulate, inferior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate), and fornix fibers in 12 young and 12 elderly healthy men and women and tested functional correlates with concurrent assessment of a wide range of neuropsychological abilities. Principal component analysis of cognitive and motor tests on which the elderly achieved significantly lower scores than the young group was used for data reduction and yielded three factors: Problem Solving, Working Memory, and Motor. Age effects--lower FA or higher diffusivity--in the elderly were prominent in anterior tracts, specifically, genu, fornix, and uncinate fibers. Differential correlations between FA or diffusivity in fiber tracts and scores on Problem Solving, Working Memory, or Motor factors provide convergent validity to the biological meaningfulness of the integrity of the fibers tracked. The observed pattern of relations supports the possibility that regional degradation of white matter fiber integrity is a biological source of age-related functional compromise and may have the potential to limit accessibility to alternative neural systems to compensate for compromised function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Interest in the anatomy of the insula is driven by its multifunctionality and the need for accurate visualization for surgical purposes. Few in vivo studies of human insular anatomy have been conducted due to methodological and anatomical challenges. OBJECTIVE We used brain cortical morphometry tools to accurately reconstruct insular topology and permit a detailed visualization of its gyri in 3 dimensions. METHODS Sixty healthy subjects (33 females; 37.8 ± 12.8 years) underwent 3-tesla MRI scans. The strategy for characterizing the insula was: (1) create 3-dimensional (3-D) insula representations for visual analysis; (2) rate topological features using a gyral conspicuity index; (3) identify individual variations across subjects/between groups; (4) compare to prior findings. RESULTS Insular reconstruction was achieved in 113/120 cases. The anterior short, posterior short, anterior long gyri and central sulcus were easily identified. In contrast, middle short (MSG), posterior long (PLG) and accessory gyri (AG) were highly variable. The MSG, but not the PLG or AG, was clearer in males and in the left hemisphere, suggesting sex- and laterality-related differences. CONCLUSIONS A noninvasive in vivo 3-D visualization strategy revealed anatomical variations of the insula in a healthy cohort. This methodological approach can be adopted for broad clinical and/or research purposes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether damage to the optic radiation (OR) in multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with optic nerve injury and visual dysfunction. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety referred patients with MS and 29 healthy volunteers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging indices along the OR were reconstructed with diffusion tensor tractography. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and visual acuity at high and low contrast were measured in a subset of the MS group (n = 36). RESULTS: All tested magnetic resonance imaging indices (fractional anisotropy [FA]; mean, parallel, and perpendicular [lambda( perpendicular)] diffusivity; T2 relaxation time; and magnetization transfer ratio) were significantly abnormal in patients with MS. Mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was significantly correlated with FA (r = 0.55; P {\textless} .001) and lambda( perpendicular) (r = -0.37; P = .001). The retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in the nasal retinal quadrant was also specifically correlated with FA and lambda( perpendicular) in the synaptically connected contralateral OR. In individuals with less severely damaged optic nerves (mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness {\textgreater}80 mum), letter acuity scores at 2.5{\%} contrast were correlated with OR-specific FA (r = 0.55; P = .004), lambda( perpendicular) (r = -0.40; P = .04), and magnetization transfer ratio (r = 0.54; P = .01), as well as the fraction of OR volume made up of lesions (r = -0.69; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: Fractional anisotropy and lambda( perpendicular) are potentially useful quantitative magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers of OR-specific damage in MS. Such damage is associated with retinal injury and visual disability},

abstract = {In humans, the anterior insula (aI) has been the topic of considerable research and ascribed a vast number of functional properties by way of neuroimaging and lesion studies. Here, we argue that the aI, at least in part, plays a role in domain-general attentional control and highlight studies (Dosenbach et al. 2006; Dosenbach et al. 2007) supporting this view. Additionally, we discuss a study (Ploran et al. 2007) that implicates aI in processes related to the capture of focal attention. Task-level control and focal attention may or may not reflect information processing supported by a single functional area (within the aI). Therefore, we apply a novel technique (Cohen et al. 2008) that utilizes resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to determine whether separable regions exist within the aI. rs-fcMRI mapping suggests that the ventral portion of the aI is distinguishable from more dorsal/anterior regions, which are themselves distinct from more posterior parts of the aI. When these regions are applied to functional MRI (fMRI) data, the ventral and dorsal/anterior regions support processes potentially related to both task-level control and focal attention, whereas the more posterior aI regions did not. These findings suggest that there exists some functional heterogeneity within aI that may subserve related but distinct types of higher-order cognitive processing.},

Because high-field MR imaging promises higher SNR and resolution, the aim of this study was to determine the value of high-resolution 3D-CISS and 3D-TOF MRA at 3T compared with 1.5T in patients with NVC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients with NVC, trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia were examined at 1.5T and 3T, including high-resolution 3D-CISS and 3D-TOF MRA sequences. Delineation of anatomic structures, overall image quality, severity of artifacts, visibility of NVC, and assessment of the SNR and CNR were compared between field strengths. RESULTS: SNR and CNR were significantly higher at 3T (P {\textless} .001). Significantly better anatomic conspicuity, including delineation of CNs, nerve branches, and assessment of small vessels, was obtained at 3T (P {\textless} .02). Severity of artifacts was significantly lower at 3T (P {\textless} .001). Consequently, overall image quality was significantly higher at 3T. NVC was significantly better delineated at 3T (P {\textless} .001). Six patients in whom NVC was not with certainty identifiable at 1.5T were correctly diagnosed at 3T. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NVC may benefit from the higher resolution and greater sensitivity of 3T for preoperative assessment of NVC, and 3T may be of particular value when 1.5T is equivocal},

abstract = {High angular resolution diffusion imaging has recently been of great interest in characterizing non-Gaussian diffusion processes. One important goal is to obtain more accurate fits of the apparent diffusion processes in these non-Gaussian regions, thus overcoming the limitations of classical diffusion tensor imaging. This paper presents an extensive study of high-order models for apparent diffusion coefficient estimation and illustrates some of their applications. Using a meaningful modified spherical harmonics basis to capture the physical constraints of the problem, a new regularization algorithm is proposed. The new smoothing term is based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator and its closed form implementation is used in the fitting procedure. Next, the linear transformation between the coefficients of a spherical harmonic series of order l and independent elements of a rank-l high-order diffusion tensor is explicitly derived. This relation allows comparison of the state-of-the-art anisotropy measures computed from spherical harmonics and tensor coefficients. Published results are reproduced accurately and it is also possible to recover voxels with isotropic, single fiber anisotropic, and multiple fiber anisotropic diffusion. Validation is performed on apparent diffusion coefficients from synthetic data, from a biological phantom, and from a human brain dataset.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The inferior alveolar nerve is the third branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve and one of the important nerves in dental treatment clinically. In particular, in the assessment of nerve invasion by malignant tumors of jaw bone, diagnostic imaging of the inferior alveolar nerve is essential. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the application of diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) in the mandible for the visualization of the inferior alveolar nerve as an initial experiment. STUDY DESIGN: The subjects were 10 healthy volunteers. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed using a 1.5-T MR unit (Intera Achiva; Philips Medical Systems). The raw data from the DTT sequence images were transferred to an off-line workstation, which used Philips Research Imaging Development Environment software for image registration and fiber tracking. RESULTS: Because the signal-to-noise ratio in DTT of oral and maxillofacial structures was low, it was difficult to set regions of interest exactly on the inferior alveolar nerve, though this becomes easier by overlaying of T1-weighted images. Thus the inferior alveolar nerve was observed running inside of the mandible in all tested cases. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we successfully visualized the inferior alveolar nerve by the automatic fiber tracking method of DTT in normal volunteers. Further application and assessment will be necessary in pathologic states of the mandible},

Although various anatomical maps of this region have been published over the last century, these schemes show variable results. Moreover, none can directly be integrated with functional imaging data. Hence, our current knowledge about the structure-function relationships in this region remains limited. We therefore remapped the posterior part of the human insular cortex in 10 postmortem brains using an observer-independent approach. This analysis revealed the existence of 3 cytoarchitectonically distinct areas in the posterior insula. The examined brains were then 3D reconstructed and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute single-subject template. Probabilistic maps for each area were calculated by superimposing the individual delineations, and a cytoarchitectonic summary map was computed to chart the regional architectonic organization. These maps can be used to identify the anatomical correlates of functional activations observed in neuroimaging studies and to understand the microstructural correlates of the functional segregation of the human posterior insula.},

The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

abstract = {Most work in relation extraction forms a prediction by looking at a short span of text within a single sentence containing a single entity pair mention. However, many relation types, particularly in biomedical text, are expressed across sentences or require a large context to disambiguate. We propose a model to consider all mention and entity pairs simultaneously in order to make a prediction. We encode full paper abstracts using an efficient self-attention encoder and form pairwise predictions between all mentions with a bi-affine operation. An entity-pair wise pooling aggregates mention pair scores to make a final prediction while alleviating training noise by performing within document multi-instance learning. We improve our model's performance by jointly training the model to predict named entities and adding an additional corpus of weakly labeled data. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness by achieving the state of the art on the Biocreative V Chemical Disease Relation dataset for models without KB resources, outperforming ensembles of models which use hand-crafted features and additional linguistic resources.},

abstract = {We compared hippocampal volume measures obtained by manual tracing to automatic segmentation with FreeSurfer in 44 younger (20-30 years) and 47 older (60-70 years) adults, each measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over three successive time points, separated by four months. Retest correlations over time were very high for both manual and FreeSurfer segmentations. With FreeSurfer, correlations over time were significantly lower in the older than in the younger age group, which was not the case with manual segmentation. Pearson correlations between manual and FreeSurfer estimates were sufficiently high, numerically even higher in the younger group, whereas intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) estimates were lower in the younger than in the older group. FreeSurfer yielded higher volume estimates than manual segmentation, particularly in the younger age group. Importantly, FreeSurfer consistently overestimated hippocampal volumes independently of manually assessed volume in the younger age group, but overestimated larger volumes in the older age group to a less extent, introducing a systematic age bias in the data. Age differences in hippocampal volumes were significant with FreeSurfer, but not with manual tracing. Manual tracing resulted in a significant difference between left and right hippocampus (right {\textgreater} left), whereas this asymmetry effect was considerably smaller with FreeSurfer estimates. We conclude that FreeSurfer constitutes a feasible method to assess differences in hippocampal volume in young adults. FreeSurfer estimates in older age groups should, however, be interpreted with care until the automatic segmentation pipeline has been further optimized to increase validity and reliability in this age group.

abstract = {Glutamatergic synapses play critical roles in brain functions and diseases. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a most effective cellular model for investigating the synaptic changes that underlie learning as well as brain disease--although different molecular mechanisms are likely involved in LTP in physiological and pathological conditions. In the case of learning, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is known to be important for triggering learning-related plasticity; alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic (AMPA) receptors are thought to be important for the expression of synaptic changes. In this review, I will examine recent evidence on the novel roles of NMDA receptors, in particular NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors in learning and chronic pain. A positive feedback control of NR2B receptor subunit is proposed to explain cortical sensitization involved in chronic pain, but not learning and memory},

Despite its ease of implementation, SGDs are diffi- cult to tune and parallelize. These problems make it challenging to develop, debug and scale up deep learning algorithms with SGDs. In this paper, we show that more sophisti- cated off-the-shelf optimizationmethods such as Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and Conjugate gradient (CG) with line search can significantly simplify and speed up the process of pretraining deep algorithms. In our experiments, the difference between L- BFGS/CG and SGDs are more pronounced if we consider algorithmic extensions (e.g., sparsity regularization) and hardware ex- tensions (e.g., GPUs or computer clusters). Our experiments with distributed optimiza- tion support the use of L-BFGS with locally connected networks and convolutional neural networks. Using L-BFGS, our convolutional network model achieves 0.69{\%} on the stan- dard MNIST dataset. This is a state-of-the- art result on MNIST among algorithms that do not use distortions or pretraining.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the percutaneous procedures for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, percutaneous anhydrous glycerol rhizolysis (PRGR) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of trigeminal neuralgia have stood the test of time. OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was conducted to compare PRGR and RF ablation techniques in patients with trigeminal neuralgia in terms of (1) efficacy of pain relief, (2) duration of pain relief and (3) side effects. METHODS: All patients presenting to our pain clinic for the first time for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia were enrolled to receive either PRGR or RF ablation; the treatment was chosen by the patient. Demographic data, magnetic resonance imaging scan, relevant medical disease, amount of anhydrous glycerol, lesion temperature, and total duration of RF were noted. The presence or absence of cerebrospinal fluid egress, immediate pain relief, duration of pain-free period, need for repeat injection or additional peripheral nerve block, and recurrence of pain were also noted. The degree of pain relief was recorded every 3 months. Any complications during the procedure and side effects were also recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients underwent either PRGR (n = 40) or RF thermocoagulation (n = 39). A total of 23 patients (58.9{\%}) in the PRGR group and 33 patients (84.6{\%}) in the RF group experienced excellent pain relief. The mean duration of excellent pain relief in the PRGR and RF groups was comparable. By the end of the study period, 39.1{\%} patients in the PRGR group and 51.5{\%} patients in the RF group experienced recurrence of pain. CONCLUSION: Both PRGR and RF techniques can achieve acceptable pain relief with minimal side effects},

abstract = {Parcellation of the human thalamus based on cortical connectivity information inferred from non-invasive diffusion-weighted images identifies sub-regions that we have proposed correspond to nuclei. Here we test the functional and anatomical validity of this proposal by comparing data from diffusion tractography, cytoarchitecture and functional imaging. We acquired diffusion imaging data in eleven healthy subjects and performed probabilistic tractography from voxels within the thalamus. Cortical connectivity information was used to divide the thalamus into sub-regions with highest probability of connectivity to distinct cortical areas. The relative volumes of these connectivity-defined sub-regions correlate well with volumetric predictions based on a histological atlas. Previously reported centres of functional activation within the thalamus during motor or executive tasks co-localize within atlas regions showing high probabilities of connection to motor or prefrontal cortices, respectively. This work provides a powerful validation of quantitative grey matter segmentation using diffusion tractography in humans. Co-registering thalamic sub-regions from 11 healthy individuals characterizes inter-individual variation in segmentation and results in a population-based atlas of the human thalamus that can be used to assign likely anatomical labels to thalamic locations in standard brain space. This provides a tool for specific localization of functional activations or lesions to putative thalamic nuclei},

Use of an accurate streamlines propagation mask from segmentation of an anatomical image confines the streamlines to the volume of the brain white matter, but does not take full advantage of all of the information available from such an image. We present a modular addition to streamlines tractography, which makes more effective use of the information available from anatomical image segmentation, and the known properties of the neuronal axons being reconstructed, to apply biologically realistic priors to the streamlines generated; we refer to this as "Anatomically-Constrained Tractography". Results indicate that some of the known false positives associated with tractography algorithms are prevented, such that the biological accuracy of the reconstructions should be improved, provided that state-of-the-art streamlines tractography methods are used.},

Many mapping studies investigating both pain conditions are now available, and the latest tools for coordinate-based meta-analysis offer the possibility of random effects statistics. We performed a meta-analysis based on a literature search of published functional magnetic resonance imaging group studies to compare patterns of activity during experimentally induced and chronic neuropathic pain, for the later including four fibromyalgia studies. Stimulus-dependent activation in experimental pain was further divided into "thermal" and "non thermal" stimuli. A conjunction of experimentally induced and chronic neuropathic pain revealed activation of the bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex, right middle cingulate cortex, right inferior parietal lobe, supplementary motor area, right caudal anterior insula, and bilateral thalamus. Primary somatosensory activation was only observed during experimental non-thermal stimulation. Chronic neuropathic pain studies showed increased activation in the left secondary somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and right caudal anterior insula when compared to experimentally induced pain. Activation clusters in the anterior cingulate cortex and caudal anterior insula suggest a strong emotional contribution to the processing of chronic neuropathic pain.},

Numerous studies have examined the relationship between memory performance and hippocampal volumes in participants without neurological or psychiatric disorders, with widely varying results. Three hypotheses about volume-memory relationships in the normal human brain are discussed: "bigger is always better", a neuropsychological view that volume decreases due to normal aging are accompanied by memory decline, and a developmental perspective that regressive events in development may result in negative correlations between hippocampal volume and memory ability. Meta-analysis of results from 33 studies led to little support for the bigger-is-better hypothesis. A negative relationship between hippocampal volume and memory (smaller is better) was significant for studies with children, adolescents, and young adults. For studies with older adults, the most striking observation was extreme variability: the evidence for a positive relationship between hippocampal size and episodic memory ability in older adults was surprisingly weak. Some of the variability in results from older adults was associated with statistical methods of normalizing for age and head size, which are discussed.},

To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200×200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70{\%} relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {OBJECT: In this study, the authors used a fiber-dissection technique to describe the optic radiation. They focused on the morphological characteristics (length and breadth) of this structure, its course, and its relationships with neighboring fasciculi and the lateral ventricle. METHODS: The authors dissected 10 previously frozen, formalin-fixed human brains with the aid of an operating microscope by following the fiber dissection technique described by Klingler in 1960. Lateral, inferior, and medial approaches were made. The optic radiation, also known as the Gratiolet radiation, extended from the lateral geniculate body to the calcarine fissure. The average distance from the tip of the anterior Meyer loop to the calcarine sulcus was 105 mm (range 95-114 mm). The breadth of the optic radiations, one on each side of the brain, averaged 17 mm at the level of the inferior horn (range 15-18 mm). This tract could be divided into three main segments: the anterior or Meyer loop, the body, and the end of the optic radiation. Adjacent anatomical structures included: laterally, the inferior longitudinal fasciculi; medially, the tapetum of the corpus callosum; and the ependyma of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: Various practical surgical approaches are discussed. The knowledge gained by studying this particular anatomy will help prevent injury to the optic radiations during neurosurgery},

abstract = {OBJECT: The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region of the brainstem has become a new stimulation target for the treatment of gait freezing, akinesia, and postural instability in advanced Parkinson disease (PD). Because PD locomotor symptoms are probably caused by excessive gamma-aminobutyric acidergic inhibition of the PPN, low-frequency stimulation of the PPN may overcome this inhibition and improve the symptoms. However, the anatomical connections of this region in humans are not known in any detail. METHODS: Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired at 1.5 teslas, and probabilistic tractography was used to trace the connections of the PPN region in eight healthy volunteers. A single seed voxel (2 x 2 x 2 mm) was chosen in the PPN just lateral to the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, and the Diffusion Toolbox of the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain was used to process the acquired MR images. The connections of each volunteer's PPN region were analyzed using a human brain MR imaging atlas. RESULTS: The PPN region was connected with the cerebellum and spinal cord below and to the thalamus, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and motor cortex above. The regions of the primary motor cortex that control the trunk and upper and lower extremities had the highest connectivity compared with other parts of motor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that connections of the PPN region with the primary motor cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord may play important roles in the regulation of movement by the PPN region. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography of the PPN region may be used preoperatively to optimize placement of stimulation electrodes and postoperatively it may also be useful to reassess electrode positions},

abstract = {One of the histological hallmarks of early multiple sclerosis lesions is primary demyelination, with myelin destruction and relative sparing of axons. On the other hand, it is widely accepted that axonal loss occurs in, and is responsible for, the permanent disability characterizing the later chronic progressive stage of the disease. In this study, we have used an antibody against amyloid precursor protein, known to be a sensitive marker of axonal damage in a number of other contexts, in immunocytochemical experiments on paraffin embedded multiple sclerosis lesions of varying ages in order to see at which stage of the disease axonal damage, in addition to demyelination, occurs and may thus contribute to the development of disability in patients. The results show the expression of amyloid precursor protein in damaged axons within acute multiple sclerosis lesions, and in the active borders of less acute lesions. This observation may have implications for the design and timing of therapeutic intervention, one of the most important aims of which must be the reduction of permanent disability.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) was applied for in vivo quantification of myelin loss and regeneration. A transgenic mouse line (Oligo-TTK) expressing a truncated form of the herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase gene (hsv1-tk) in oligodendrocytes was studied along with two induced phenotypes of myelin pathology. Myelin loss and axonal abnormalities differentially affect values of DT-MRI parameters in the brain of transgenic mice. Changes in the anisotropy of the white matter were assessed by calculating and mapping the radial (D perpendicular) and axial (D parallel) water diffusion to axonal tracts and fractional anisotropy (FA). A significant increase in D perpendicular attributed to the lack of myelin was observed in all selected brain white matter tracts in dysmyelinated mice. Lower D parallel values were consistent with the histological observation of axonal modifications, including reduced axonal caliber and overexpression of neurofilaments and III beta-tubulin. We show clearly that myelination and axonal changes play a role in the degree of diffusion anisotropy, because FA was significantly decreased in dysmyelinated brain. Importantly, myelin reparation during brain postnatal development induced a decrease in the magnitude of D( perpendicular) and an increase in FA compared with the same brain before recovery. The progressive increase in D parallel values was attributed to the gain in normal axonal morphology. This regeneration was confirmed by the detection of enlarged oligodendrocyte population, newly formed myelin sheaths around additional axons, and a gradual increase in axonal caliber},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used widely to show structural brain changes during both development and aging. Lifespan studies are valuable because they connect these two processes, yet few DTI studies have been conducted that include both children and elderly subjects. This study used DTI tractography to investigate 12 major white matter connections in 403 healthy subjects aged 5-83 years. Poisson fits were used to model changes of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) across the age span, and were highly significant for all tracts. FA increased during childhood and adolescence, reached a peak between 20 and 42 years of age, and then decreased. MD showed an opposite trend, decreasing first, reaching a minimum at 18-41 years, and then increasing later in life. These trajectories demonstrate rates and timing of development and degradation that vary regionally in the brain. The corpus callosum and fornix showed early reversals of development trends, while frontal-temporal connections (cingulum, uncinate, superior longitudinal) showed more prolonged maturation and delayed declines. FA changes were driven by perpendicular diffusivity, suggesting changes of myelination and/or axonal density. Tract volume changed significantly with age for most tracts, but did not greatly influence the FA and MD trajectories. This study demonstrates clear age-related microstructural changes throughout the brain white matter, and provides normative data that will be useful for studying white matter development in a variety of diseases and abnormal conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) requires exclusion of diseases that could better explain the clinical and paraclinical findings. A systematic process for exclusion of alternative diagnoses has not been defined. An International Panel of MS experts developed consensus perspectives on MS differential diagnosis. METHODS: Using available literature and consensus, we developed guidelines for MS differential diagnosis, focusing on exclusion of potential MS mimics, diagnosis of common initial isolated clinical syndromes, and differentiating between MS and non-MS idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases. RESULTS: We present recommendations for 1) clinical and paraclinical red flags suggesting alternative diagnoses to MS; 2) more precise definition of "clinically isolated syndromes" (CIS), often the first presentations of MS or its alternatives; 3) algorithms for diagnosis of three common CISs related to MS in the optic nerves, brainstem, and spinal cord; and 4) a classification scheme and diagnosis criteria for idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: Differential diagnosis leading to MS or alternatives is complex and a strong evidence base is lacking. Consensus-determined guidelines provide a practical path for diagnosis and will be useful for the non-MS specialist neurologist. Recommendations are made for future research to validate and support these guidelines. Guidance on the differential diagnosis process when MS is under consideration will enhance diagnostic accuracy and precision.},

Researchers have previously used qualitative visual inspection to gauge hippocampal atrophy. The purpose of this study was to determine the best measure(s) of hippocampal size for predicting memory functioning in 102 community-dwelling individuals over 80 years of age. Hippocampal size was estimated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetry and qualitative visual assessment. Right and left hippocampal volumes were adjusted by three different estimates of head size: total intracranial volume (TICV), whole-brain volume including ventricles (WB+V) and a more refined measure of whole-brain volume with ventricles extracted (WB). We compared the relative efficacy of these three volumetric adjustment methods and visual ratings of hippocampal size in predicting memory performance using linear regression. All four measures of hippocampal size were significant predictors of memory performance. TICV-adjusted volumes performed most poorly in accounting for variance in memory scores. Hippocampal volumes adjusted by either measure of whole-brain volume performed equally well, although qualitative visual ratings of the hippocampus were at least as effective as the volumetric measures in predicting memory performance in community-dwelling individuals in the ninth or tenth decade of life.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The purpose of this paper is to report on the authors' advanced presurgical interactive virtual simulation technique using a 3D computer graphics model for microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery. METHODS: The authors performed interactive virtual simulation prior to surgery in 26 patients with trigeminal neuralgia or hemifacial spasm. The 3D computer graphics models for interactive virtual simulation were composed of the brainstem, cerebellum, cranial nerves, vessels, and skull individually created by the image analysis, including segmentation, surface rendering, and data fusion for data collected by 3-T MRI and 64-row multidetector CT systems. Interactive virtual simulation was performed by employing novel computer-aided design software with manipulation of a haptic device to imitate the surgical procedures of bone drilling and retraction of the cerebellum. The findings were compared with intraoperative findings. RESULTS: In all patients, interactive virtual simulation provided detailed and realistic surgical perspectives, of sufficient quality, representing the lateral suboccipital route. The causes of trigeminal neuralgia or hemifacial spasm determined by observing 3D computer graphics models were concordant with those identified intraoperatively in 25 (96{\%}) of 26 patients, which was a significantly higher rate than the 73{\%} concordance rate (concordance in 19 of 26 patients) obtained by review of 2D images only (p {\textless} 0.05). Surgeons evaluated interactive virtual simulation as having "prominent" utility for carrying out the entire surgical procedure in 50{\%} of cases. It was evaluated as moderately useful or "supportive" in the other 50{\%} of cases. There were no cases in which it was evaluated as having no utility. The utilities of interactive virtual simulation were associated with atypical or complex forms of neurovascular compression and structural restrictions in the surgical window. Finally, MVD procedures were performed as simulated in 23 (88{\%}) of the 26 patients . CONCLUSIONS: Our interactive virtual simulation using a 3D computer graphics model provided a realistic environment for performing virtual simulations prior to MVD surgery and enabled us to ascertain complex microsurgical anatomy},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a method of assessing brain gray matter volume that has previously been applied to various chronic pain conditions. From this previous work, it appears that chronic pain is associated with altered brain morphology. The present study was undertaken to assess these potential alterations in patients with painful hip osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: We studied 16 patients with unilateral right-sided hip pain, before and 9 months after hip arthroplasty. This enabled comparison of gray matter volume in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain versus healthy controls, as well as identification of any changes in volume following alleviation of pain (after surgery). Assessment involved self-completion questionnaires to assess pain, function, and psychosocial variables, and magnetic resonance imaging scanning of the brain for VBM analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in brain gray matter volume between healthy controls and patients with painful hip arthritis were seen. Specifically, areas of the thalamus in patients with chronic OA pain exhibited decreased gray matter volume. Furthermore, when these preoperative changes were compared with the brain morphology of the patients 9 months after surgery, the areas of reduced thalamic gray matter volume were found to have "reversed" to levels seen in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm that gray matter volume decreases within the left thalamus in the presence of chronic pain and disability in patients with hip OA. The results also show that these thalamic volume changes reverse after hip arthroplasty and are associated with decreased pain and increased function. These findings have potential implications with regard to optimizing the timing of orthopedic interventions such as arthroplasty},

METHODS: Twenty-five patients (50 sides) underwent MR imaging using the 3D constructive interference in steady-state (CISS) sequence, as well as noncontrast and contrast-enhanced 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography. Two individuals scored these studies by consensus to determine how well these sequences displayed the neurovascular contacts and nerve root bundles of CNs IX and X and the cranial and spinal roots of CN XI. Landmarks useful for identifying each lower CN were specifically sought. RESULTS: The 3D CISS sequence successfully depicted CNs IX and X in 100{\%} of the sides. Nerve root bundles of the cranial segment of CN XI were identified in 88{\%} of the sides and those of the spinal segment of CN XI were noted in 93{\%} of the sides. Landmarks useful in identifying the lower CNs included the vagal trigone, the choroid plexus of the lateral recess, the glossopharyngeal and vagal meatus, the inferior petrosal sinus, and the vertebral artery. The combined use of 3D CISS and 3D TOF sequences demonstrated neurovascular contacts at the nerve root entry or exit zones in 19{\%} of all nerves visualized. CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of 3D CISS MR imaging and 3D TOF MR angiography (with or without contrast) successfully displays the detailed anatomy of the lower CNs and adjacent structures in vivo.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although diffusion tensor imaging has been a major research focus for Alzheimer's disease in recent years, it remains unclear whether it has sufficient stability to have biomarker potential. To date, frequently inconsistent results have been reported, though lack of standardisation in acquisition and analysis make such discrepancies difficult to interpret. There is also, at present, little knowledge of how the biometric properties of diffusion tensor imaging might evolve in the course of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The biomarker question was addressed in this study by adopting a standardised protocol both for the whole brain (tract-based spatial statistics), and for a region of interest: the midline corpus callosum. In order to study the evolution of tensor changes, cross-sectional data from very mild (N = 21) and mild (N = 22) Alzheimer's disease patients were examined as well as a longitudinal cohort (N = 16) that had been rescanned at 12 months. FINDINGS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The results revealed that increased axial and mean diffusivity are the first abnormalities to occur and that the first region to develop such significant differences was mesial parietal/splenial white matter; these metrics, however, remained relatively static with advancing disease indicating they are suitable as 'state-specific' markers. In contrast, increased radial diffusivity, and therefore decreased fractional anisotropy-though less detectable early-became increasingly abnormal with disease progression, and, in the splenium of the corpus callosum, correlated significantly with dementia severity; these metrics therefore appear 'stage-specific' and would be ideal for monitoring disease progression. In addition, the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses showed that the progressive abnormalities in radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy always occurred in areas that had first shown an increase in axial and mean diffusivity. Given that the former two metrics correlate with dementia severity, but the latter two did not, it would appear that increased axial diffusivity represents an upstream event that precedes neuronal loss.},

Comparison of the different patterns of staining on unfolded maps of the insula revealed: 1) parallel ventral to dorsal gradients of increasing myelin, PV- and AChE-containing fibers in middle layers, and of SMI-32 pyramidal neurons in supragranular layers, with merging of dorsal and ventral high-density bands in posterior insula, 2) definition of an insula "proper" restricted to two-thirds of the "morphological" insula (as bounded by the limiting sulcus) and characterized most notably by lower PV, and 3) the insula proper is bordered along its dorsal, posterodorsal, and posteroventral margin by a strip of cortex extending beyond the limits of the morphological insula and continuous architectonically with frontoparietal and temporal opercular areas related to gustatory, somatosensory, and auditory modalities.},

abstract = {The results of Deep Brain Stimulation in deafferentation pain syndromes, in particular in thalamic pain, indicate that excellent long-term pain relief can hardly ever be achieved. We report 7 cases using Motor-Cortex-Stimulation for treating severe trigeminal neuropathic pain syndromes, i.e., dysaesthesia, anaesthesia dolorosa and postherpetic neuralgia. The first implantation of the stimulation device for precentral cerebral stimulation was performed in June 1993, the last in September 1995. In all but one case the impulse-generator was implanted after a successful period of test stimulation. Successful means a pain reduction of more than 50{\%} as assessed with a Visual Analogue Scale. Excluding one case, in whom a prolonged focal seizure resulting in a postictal speech arrest occurred during test stimulation, there have been no operative complications and the postoperative course was uneventful. In all the other patients the pain inhibition appeared below the threshold for producing motor effects. Initially these patients reported a good to excellent pain relief. In three of 6 patients a good to excellent pain control was maintained for a follow-up period of 5 months to 2 years. In the remaining three patients the positive effect decreased over several months.},

abstract = {On the basis of task-related imaging studies in normal human subjects, it has been suggested that two attention systems exist in the human brain: a bilateral dorsal attention system involved in top-down orienting of attention and a right-lateralized ventral attention system involved in reorienting attention in response to salient sensory stimuli. An important question is whether this functional organization emerges only in response to external attentional demands or is represented more fundamentally in the internal dynamics of brain activity. To address this question, we examine correlations in spontaneous fluctuations of the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the absence of task, stimuli, or explicit attentional demands. We identify a bilateral dorsal attention system and a right-lateralized ventral attention system solely on the basis of spontaneous activity. Further, we observe regions in the prefrontal cortex correlated with both systems, a potential mechanism for mediating the functional interaction between systems. These findings demonstrate that the neuroanatomical substrates of human attention persist in the absence of external events, reflected in the correlation structure of spontaneous activity.},

Ten dry skulls and 10 skull-base specimens were investigated in the present study. In cadaveric skull-base specimens, the anatomical relationships between the foramen ovale, mandibular nerve and Gasserian ganglion and the surrounding neurovascular structures were investigated intradurally. The distance between the foramen ovale and Gasserian ganglion was measured as 6 mm. The abducent nerve, adjacent to the anterior tail of the petrolingual ligament, was observed passing along the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. Advancement of the catheter more than 10 mm from the foramen ovale is likely to damage the internal carotid artery and the abducent nerve at the medial side of the petrolingual ligament. Thermocoagulation of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus may damage the cranial nerves by heat, giving rise to pareses.},

abstract = {Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic neuropathic facial pain disorder that commonly responds to surgery. A proportion of patients, however, do not benefit and suffer ongoing pain. There are currently no imaging tools that permit the prediction of treatment response. To address this paucity, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to determine whether pre-surgical trigeminal nerve microstructural diffusivities can prognosticate response to TN treatment. In 31 TN patients and 16 healthy controls, multi-tensor tractography was used to extract DTI-derived metrics-axial (AD), radial (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA)-from the cisternal segment, root entry zone and pontine segment of trigeminal nerves for false discovery rate-corrected Student's t-tests. Ipsilateral diffusivities were bootstrap resampled to visualize group-level diffusivity thresholds of long-term response. To obtain an individual-level statistical classifier of surgical response, we conducted discriminant function analysis (DFA) with the type of surgery chosen alongside ipsilateral measurements and ipsilateral/contralateral ratios of AD and RD from all regions of interest as prediction variables. Abnormal diffusivity in the trigeminal pontine fibers, demonstrated by increased AD, highlighted non-responders (n = 14) compared to controls. Bootstrap resampling revealed three ipsilateral diffusivity thresholds of response-pontine AD, MD, cisternal FA-separating 85{\%} of non-responders from responders. DFA produced an 83.9{\%} (71.0{\%} using leave-one-out-cross-validation) accurate prognosticator of response that successfully identified 12/14 non-responders. Our study demonstrates that pre-surgical DTI metrics can serve as a highly predictive, individualized tool to prognosticate surgical response. We further highlight abnormal pontine segment diffusivities as key features of treatment non-response and confirm the axiom that central pain does not commonly benefit from peripheral treatments.},

A simple, axially symmetric model of diffusion in white matter fibers is used to relate diffusion measurements to fiber properties. The new technique is called fiber orientation estimated using continuous axially symmetric tensors (FORECAST). It is tested using both numerical simulation and in vivo measurements. The new method agrees with other methods in voxels containing single fibers, but resolves crossing fibers better, at least at the level of diffusion weighting used in this study (tr(b) = 1480 s/mm2). The simplifying assumptions of the model are tested by comparison with the "model-free" q-ball analysis of in vivo data and the results are shown to be in good agreement. The new method addresses the problem of partial volume averaging in diffusion tensor imaging and provides a basis for more reliable estimates of fiber orientation and fractional anisotropy.},

abstract = {Chronic pain is associated with reduced brain gray matter and impaired cognitive ability. In this longitudinal study, we assessed whether neuroanatomical and functional abnormalities were reversible and dependent on treatment outcomes. We acquired MRI scans from chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients before (n = 18) and 6 months after (spine surgery or facet joint injections; n = 14) treatment. In addition, we scanned 16 healthy controls, 10 of which returned 6 months after the first visit. We performed cortical thickness analysis on structural MRI scans, and subjects performed a cognitive task during the functional MRI. We compared patients and controls, as well as patients before versus after treatment. After treatment, patients had increased cortical thickness in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was thinner before treatment compared with controls. Increased DLPFC thickness correlated with the reduction of both pain and physical disability. Additionally, increased thickness in primary motor cortex was associated specifically with reduced physical disability, and right anterior insula was associated specifically with reduced pain. Left DLPFC activity during an attention-demanding cognitive task was abnormal before treatment, but normalized following treatment. These data indicate that functional and structural brain abnormalities-specifically in the left DLPFC-are reversible, suggesting that treating chronic pain can restore normal brain function in humans},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterized by paroxysms of severe facial pain but without the major sensory loss that commonly accompanies neuropathic pain. Since neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone does not fully explain the pathogenesis of TN, we determined whether there were brain gray matter abnormalities in a cohort of idiopathic TN patients. We used structural MRI to test the hypothesis that TN is associated with altered gray matter (GM) in brain areas involved in the sensory and affective aspects of pain, pain modulation, and motor function. We further determined the contribution of long-term TN on GM plasticity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Cortical thickness and subcortical GM volume were measured from high-resolution 3T T1-weighted MRI scans in 24 patients with right-sided TN and 24 healthy control participants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: TN patients had increased GM volume in the sensory thalamus, amygdala, periaqueductal gray, and basal ganglia (putamen, caudate, nucleus accumbens) compared to healthy controls. The patients also had greater cortical thickness in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex and frontal pole compared to controls. In contrast, patients had thinner cortex in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, the insula and the orbitofrontal cortex. No relationship was observed between GM abnormalities and TN pain duration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: TN is associated with GM abnormalities in areas involved in pain perception, pain modulation and motor function. These findings may reflect increased nociceptive input to the brain, an impaired descending modulation system that does not adequately inhibit pain, and increased motor output to control facial movements to limit pain attacks.},

abstract = {Background: Several authors have used advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to investigate whether patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) have occult damage in normal-appearing brain tissue, similarly to multiple sclerosis (MS). To date, the literature contains no data derived from the combined use of several advanced MRI techniques in the same NMO subjects.Objective: We set out to determine whether occult damage could be detected in the normal-appearing brain tissue of a small group of patients with NMO using a multiparametric MRI approach.Methods: Eight female patients affected by NMO (age range 44-58 years) and seven sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included. The techniques used on a 1.5 T MRI imaging scanner were magnetization transfer imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, tract-based spatial statistics, spectroscopy and voxel-based morphometry in order to analyse normal-appearing white matter and normal-appearing grey matter.Results: Structural and metabolic parameters showed no abnormalities in normal-appearing white matter of patients with NMO. Conversely, tract-based spatial statistics demonstrated a selective alteration of the optic pathways and the lateral geniculate nuclei. Diffusion tensor imaging values in the normal-appearing grey matter were found to be significantly different in the patients with NMO versus the healthy controls. Moreover, voxel-based morphometry analysis demonstrated a significant density and volume reduction of the sensorimotor cortex and the visual cortex.Conclusions: Our data disclosed occult structural damage in the brain of patients with NMO, predominantly involving regions connected with motor and visual systems. This damage seems to be the direct consequence of transsynaptic degeneration triggered by lesions of the optic nerve and spine.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease of motor neurons, characterized by depositions of neurofilaments in the perikarya and proximal axons. The pathogenesis of ALS remains poorly understood, but two lines of evidence suggest that neurofilament accumulation may play a causal role. First, transgenic mice that overexpress neurofilament proteins show motor neuron degeneration and, second, variant alleles of the neurofilament heavy-subunit gene (NF-H) have been found in some human ALS patients. To investigate how disorganized neurofilaments might cause neurodegeneration, we examined axonal transport of newly synthesized proteins in mice that overexpress the human NF-H gene. We observed dramatic defects of axonal transport, not only of neurofilament proteins but also of other proteins, including tubulin and actin. Ultrastructural analysis revealed a paucity of cytoskeletal elements, smooth endoplasmic reticulum and especially mitochondria in the degenerating axons. We therefore propose that the neurofilament accumulations observed in these mice cause axonal degeneration by impeding the transport of components required for axonal maintenance, and that a similar mechanism may account for the pathogenesis of ALS in human patients.},

abstract = {We have examined the ultrastructure of the trigeminal sensory nerve root in three patients with medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia. In one patient, the nerve root was sandwiched between a large vein and a small pontine artery, in the others compression was due to marked dolichoectasia of a verterbal artery. Because these were not amenable to microvascular decompression, a caudal rhizotomy was performed, by excising a short inferior segment of nerve root in the region of indentation. In all cases, examination revealed a zone of chronic demyelination in the proximal (centrally myelinated) part of the root, near its junction with peripheral nerve. The zone of demyelination contained closely packed axons without intervening glial cytoplasm. Also present were small numbers of thinly myelinated axons. In some cases a single thin myelin sheath encircled several adjacent axons that were still in close apposition. These findings indicate that the trigeminal neuralgia associated with vascular compression is due to demyelination. The demyelination is associated with some evidence of remyelination. The latter phenomenon may account in part for the long periods of remission, especially during the initial period after the onset of trigeminal neuralgia. The partly aberrant nature of the myelination within the region of vascular compression may contribute to the persistence of symptoms in some patients after decompressive surgery.},

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered.},

METHOD: Forty-two out-patients with bipolar disorder, 28 with schizophrenia and 37 controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging. All subjects also underwent IQ and executive assessments using tasks whose performance has been localized to the ventral or dorsal prefrontal cortex. Cortical folding was quantified using the gyrification index (GI) and related to the cognitive measures. RESULTS: Patients with bipolar disorder showed reduced prefrontal gyrification compared with controls but did not differ from patients with schizophrenia. Neither ventral nor dorsal GI was preferentially affected in either disorder. Current IQ was positively and significantly correlated with GI. CONCLUSION: Patients with bipolar disorder and patients with schizophrenia have reduced prefrontal gyrification affecting both ventral and dorsal subregions. These reductions were significantly associated with cognitive impairments occurring in both disorders},

abstract = {With the increasing importance of fiber tracking in diffusion tensor images for clinical needs, there has been a growing demand for an objective mathematical framework to perform quantitative analysis of white matter fiber bundles incorporating their underlying physical significance. This article presents such a novel mathematical framework that facilitates mathematical operations between tracts using an inner product between fibres. Such inner product operation, based on Gaussian processes, spans a metric space. This metric facilitates combination of fiber tracts, rendering operations like tract membership to a bundle or bundle similarity simple. Based on this framework, we have designed an automated unsupervised atlas-based clustering method that does not require manual initialization nor an a priori knowledge of the number of clusters. Quantitative analysis can now be performed on the clustered tract volumes across subjects, thereby avoiding the need for point parameterization of these fibers, or the use of medial or envelope representations as in previous work. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the mathematical operations. Subsequently, the applicability of the unsupervised clustering framework has been demonstrated on a 21-subject dataset.},

abstract = {The study aimed to provide the anatomic data for puncture of foramen ovale cranium in oral cavity. We scan 100 volunteers' skull on computed tomography who have no lesion of skull base, of which the images were for three-dimensional reconstruction. The following observations and measurements were carried out: the shape, size of foramen ovale cranium, and the angle and length of puncture line. The results we got are the following: foramen ovale cranium appears as oval, kidney shape, round, pear shape, and strip shape. Foramen ovale diameter is 8.20 ± 1.54 mm, and width is 4.08 ± 0.73 mm for men and 4.23 ± 0.79 mm for female. The distance from the center of foramen ovale to the maxillary second molar is 51.65 mm for male and 48.77 mm for female. The puncture line is from the center of foramen ovale to the maxillary second molar. The angle of the puncture line with the vertical plane, which is through the midpoint of supraorbital margin and the infraorbital margin, is 40.27 degrees for men and 37.31 degrees for women. The angle of the puncture line with the horizontal plane is 49.37 degrees for men and 52.26 degrees for women. The angle of the puncture line with the sagittal plane is 3.78 degrees. All data between the left and right sides have no statistically significant difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but the diameter, the length of the puncture, and the angle of puncture line with the horizontal and vertical have significant differences on sex (P {\textless} 0.01). The anatomic character of the foramen ovale cranium has important value on the accuracy of puncture for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.},

The default mode network consistently decreases its activity when compared with activity during these relaxed nontask states. The discovery of the default mode network reignited a longstanding interest in the significance of the brain's ongoing or intrinsic activity.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Catastrophizing has been broadly conceived as an exaggerated negative "mental set" brought to bear during actual or anticipated pain experience and has risen to the status of one of the most important psychological predictors of pain. The present study aimed at investigating the relationship between catastrophizing and postoperative pain outcomes (pain intensity and analgesia use) in patients undergoing elective instrumented lumbar fusion surgery. DESIGN: On the day before surgery, 61 patients completed the Greek versions of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. On postoperative days 1 and 2, pain intensity (at rest and during activity) on the Verbal Rating Scale as well as intravenous patient-controlled analgesia fentanyl use were assessed. RESULTS: Catastrophizing and gender predicted postoperative pain intensity at rest, whereas catastrophizing emerged as the unique predictor of postoperative pain intensity during activity. Catastrophizing and anxiety predicted analgesic use. CONCLUSIONS: The present study findings suggest that it is possible to preoperatively identify patients at risk for experiencing more severe pain in the postoperative recovery period. In such cases, consideration might be given to utilizing a variety of resources to ameliorate or prevent pain.},

abstract = {The methods of group theory are applied to the problem of characterizing the diffusion measured in high angular resolution MR experiments. This leads to a natural representation of the local diffusion in terms of spherical harmonics. In this representation, it is shown that isotropic diffusion, anisotropic diffusion from a single fiber, and anisotropic diffusion from multiple fiber directions fall into distinct and separable channels. This decomposition can be determined for any voxel without any prior information by a spherical harmonic transform, and for special cases the magnitude and orientation of the local diffusion may be determined. Moreover, non-diffusion-related asymmetries produced by experimental artifacts fall into channels distinct from the fiber channels, thereby allowing their separation and a subsequent reduction in noise from the reconstructed fibers. In the case of a single fiber, the method reduces identically to the standard diffusion tensor method. The method is applied to normal volunteer brain data collected with a stimulated echo spiral high angular resolution diffusion-weighted (HARD) acquisition.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) is one of the surgical alternatives for the treatment of drug-resistant trigeminal neuralgia (TN). This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GKS in a large population of patients with TN with very long-term clinical follow-up. METHODS Between July 1992 and November 2010, 737 patients presenting with TN were treated using GKS. Data were collected prospectively and were further retrospectively evaluated at Timone University Hospital. The frequency and severity of pain, as well as trigeminal nerve function, were evaluated before GKS and regularly thereafter. Radiosurgery using the Gamma Knife (model B, C, 4C, or Perfexion) was performed with the help of both MR and CT targeting. A single 4-mm isocenter was positioned in the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve at a median distance of 7.6 mm (range 4-14 mm) anterior to the emergence of the nerve (retrogasserian target). A median maximum dose of 85 Gy (range 70-90 Gy) was prescribed. RESULTS The safety and efficacy are reported for 497 patients with medically refractory classical TN who were never previously treated by GKS and had a follow-up of at least 1 year. The median age in this series was 68.3 years (range 28.1-93.2 years). The median follow-up period was 43.8 months (range 12-174.4 months). Overall, 456 patients (91.75{\%}) were initially pain free in a median time of 10 days (range 1-180 days). Their actuarial probabilities of remaining pain free without medication at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years were 71.8{\%}, 64.9{\%}, 59.7{\%}, and 45.3{\%}, respectively. One hundred fifty-seven patients (34.4{\%}) who were initially pain free experienced at least 1 recurrence, with a median delay of onset of 24 months (range 0.6-150.1 months). However, the actuarial rate of maintaining pain relief without further surgery was 67.8{\%} at 10 years. The hypesthesia actuarial rate at 5 years was 20.4{\%} and at 7 years reached 21.1{\%}, but remained stable until 14 years with a median delay of onset of 12 months (range 1-65 months). Very bothersome facial hypesthesia was reported in only 3 patients (0.6{\%}). CONCLUSIONS Retrogasserian GKS proved to be safe and effective in the long term and in a very large number of patients. Even if the probability of long-lasting effects may be modest compared with microvascular decompression, the rarity of complications prompts discussion of using GKS as the pragmatic surgical first- or second-intention alternative for classical TN. However, a randomized trial, or at least a case-matched control study, would be required to compare with microvascular decompression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Structural neuroimaging studies have suggested an association between schizophrenia and abnormalities in brain morphology such as ventricular enlargement and differences in gray matter distribution. Less consistently reported are findings of regional abnormalities such as selective differences in thalamic volume. The authors applied an unbiased technique to test for differences in cerebral morphometry between patients with schizophrenia and matched comparison subjects. METHOD: T(1)-weighted images from 20 schizophrenic patients and matched comparison subjects were processed by using optimized automated voxel-based morphometry within multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Global differences in gray matter volume were seen between the schizophrenic and comparison subjects, with selective regional gray matter differences noted in the mediodorsal thalamus and across cortical regions, including the ventral and medial prefrontal cortices. Within the schizophrenic subjects, a relationship was observed between gray matter volume loss in the medial prefrontal cortex and a positive family history of schizophrenia. There was no significant difference between patients and comparison subjects in rates of proportional gray matter reduction with age. CONCLUSIONS: These observations confirm an association between thalamocortical morphometric abnormalities and schizophrenia, consistent with theoretical models of primary pathoetiological dysfunction in filtering, integration, and information transfer processes in patients with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Neuromodulation strategies have been proposed to treat a variety of neurological disorders, including medication-resistant epilepsy. Electrical stimulation of both central and peripheral nervous systems has emerged as a possible alternative for patients who are not deemed to be good candidates for resective procedures. In addition to well-established treatments such as vagus nerve stimulation, epilepsy centers around the world are investigating the safety and efficacy of neurostimulation at different brain targets, including the hippocampus, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus. Also promising are the preliminary results of responsive neuromodulation studies, which involve the delivery of stimulation to the brain in response to detected epileptiform or preepileptiform activity. In addition to electrical stimulation, novel therapeutic methods that may open new horizons in the management of epilepsy include transcranial magnetic stimulation, focal drug delivery, cellular transplantation, and gene therapy. We review the current strategies and future applications of neuromodulation in epilepsy.},

abstract = {We examined the health of a control group (18–81years) in our aging study, which is similar to control groups used in other neuroimaging studies. The current study was motivated by our previous results showing that one third of the elder control group had moderate to severe white matter hyperintensities and/or cortical volume loss which correlated with poor performance on memory tasks. Therefore, we predicted that cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, high cholesterol) within the control group would account for significant variance on working memory task performance. Fifty-five participants completed 4 verbal and spatial working memory tasks, neuropsychological exams, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and blood tests to assess vascular risk. In addition to using a repeated measures ANOVA design, a cluster analysis was applied to the vascular risk measures as a data reduction step to characterize relationships between conjoint risk factors. The cluster groupings were used to predict working memory performance. The results show that higher levels of systolic blood pressure were associated with: 1) poor spatial working memory accuracy; and 2) lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in multiple brain regions. In contrast, higher levels of total cholesterol corresponded with increased accuracy in verbal working memory. An association between lower FA values and higher cholesterol levels were identified in different brain regions from those associated with systolic blood pressure. The conjoint risk analysis revealed that Risk Cluster Group 3 (the group with the greatest number of risk factors) displayed: 1) the poorest performance on the spatial working memory tasks; 2) the longest reaction times across both spatial and verbal memory tasks; and 3) the lowest FA values across widespread brain regions. Our results confirm that a considerable range of vascular risk factors are present in a typical control group, even in younger individuals, which have robust effects on brain anatomy and function. These results present a new challenge to neuroimaging studies both for defining a cohort from which to characterize ‘normative' brain circuitry and for establishing a control group to compare with other clinical populations.},

abstract = {Both axon and myelin degeneration have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients with white matter disorder. However, the clinical manifestations of the neurological dysfunction caused by white matter disorders are not sufficient to determine the origin of neurological deficits. A noninvasive biological marker capable of detecting and differentiating axon and myelin degeneration would be a significant addition to currently available tools. Directional diffusivities derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been previously proposed by this group as potential biological markers to detect and differentiate axon and myelin degeneration. To further test the hypothesis that axial (lambdaparallel) and radial (lambdaperpendicular) diffusivities reflect axon and myelin pathologies, respectively, the optic nerve was examined serially using DTI in a mouse model of retinal ischemia. A significant decrease of lambdaparallel, the putative DTI axonal marker, was observed 3 days after ischemia without concurrently detectable changes in lambdaperpendicular, the putative myelin marker. This result is consistent with histological findings of significant axonal degeneration with no detectable demyelination at 3 days after ischemia. The elevation of lambdaperpendicular observed 5 days after ischemia is consistent with histological findings of myelin degeneration at this time. These results support the hypothesis that lambdaparallel and lambdaperpendicular hold promise as specific markers of axonal and myelin injury, respectively, and, further, that the coexistence of axonal and myelin degeneration does not confound this utility},

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Ninety-six patients undergoing a solitary vestibular schwannoma surgery during 2005 were included. Data concerning tumor size (Stage 1, intracanalicular; Stage 2, {\textless} or =15 mm in the cerebellopontine angle [CPA]; Stage 3, 15-30 mm in the CPA; and Stage 4, {\textgreater}30 mm in the CPA), intraoperative facial nerve displacement (Type 1, anterior to the tumor; Type 2, anterior and superior to the tumor and separated from the cochlear nerve; Type 3, superior to the tumor; and Type 4, posterior to the tumor), degree of tumor adhesion (weak, intermediate, and strong) and postoperative facial function according to the House and Brackmann classification at days 10, 30, 90 and 180 were collected. RESULTS: A good facial function (Grade 1 or 2) was reported in 73{\%} at postoperative Day 180. Univariate analysis showed that facial outcome was better in small tumors, in displacement Types 1 and 2 (Type 1, 46{\%}; Type 2, 34{\%}; and Type 3, 20{\%}), and in tumors with weak and intermediate adhesion (weak, 10{\%}; intermediate, 38{\%}; and strong, 52{\%}). Facial nerve displacement and adhesion were related to tumor stage. The combination of tumor stage, adhesion, and nerve displacement in a logistic regression model was highly predictive of postoperative facial function. CONCLUSION: Facial nerve displacement and nerve adhesion to tumor are significant predictive factors of facial function outcome after vestibular schwannoma surgery in addition to tumor size},

For the special case of classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) signals we propose the usage of the state of the art feature selection algorithms Recursive Feature Elimination and Zero-Norm Optimization which are based on the training of support vector machines (SVM). These algorithms can provide more accurate solutions than standard filter methods for feature selection. We adapt the methods for the purpose of selecting EEG channels. For a motor imagery paradigm we show that the number of used channels can be reduced significantly without increasing the classification error. The resulting best channels agree well with the expected underlying cortical activity patterns during the mental tasks. Furthermore we show how time dependent task specific information can be visualized.},

abstract = {After psychological trauma, why do some only some parts of the traumatic event return as intrusive memories while others do not? Intrusive memories are key to cognitive behavioural treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, and an aetiological understanding is warranted. We present here analyses using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and a machine learning classifier to investigate whether peri-traumatic brain activation was able to predict later intrusive memories (i.e. before they had happened). To provide a methodological basis for understanding the context of the current results, we first show how functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an experimental analogue of trauma (a trauma film) via a prospective event-related design was able to capture an individual's later intrusive memories. Results showed widespread increases in brain activation at encoding when viewing a scene in the scanner that would later return as an intrusive memory in the real world. These fMRI results were replicated in a second study. While traditional mass univariate regression analysis highlighted an association between brain processing and symptomatology, this is not the same as prediction. Using MVPA and a machine learning classifier, it was possible to predict later intrusive memories across participants with 68{\%} accuracy, and within a participant with 97{\%} accuracy; i.e. the classifier could identify out of multiple scenes those that would later return as an intrusive memory. We also report here brain networks key in intrusive memory prediction. MVPA opens the possibility of decoding brain activity to reconstruct idiosyncratic cognitive events with relevance to understanding and predicting mental health symptoms. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that electrolytic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) produce a severe deficit in contextual fear if made 1 d, but not 28 d, after fear conditioning (). As such, the hippocampus seems to play a time-limited role in the consolidation of contextual fear conditioning. Here, we examine retrograde amnesia of contextual fear produced by DH lesions in a within-subjects design. Unlike our previous reports, rats had both a remote and recent memory at the time of the lesion. Rats were given 10 tone-shock pairings in one context (remote memory) and 10 tone-shock pairings in a distinct context (with a different tone) 50 d later (recent memory), followed by DH or sham lesions 1 d later. Relative to controls, DH-lesioned rats exhibited no deficit in remote contextual fear, but recent contextual fear memory was severely impaired. They also did not exhibit deficits in tone freezing. This highly specific deficit in recent contextual memory demonstrated in a within-subjects design favors mnemonic over performance accounts of hippocampal involvement in fear. These findings also provide further support for a time-limited role of the hippocampus in memory storage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to be caused by demyelinating plaques within the nerve root entry zone, the trigeminal nucleus, or the trigeminal tracts.

OBJECTIVE: To review our experience of microvascular decompression (MVD) in patients with MS and symptomatic TN.

METHODS: All first-time MVDs for symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia in patients with MS performed by the senior author during an 8-year period (1999-2007) in this department were reviewed. The preoperative pain components were differentiated as being 100{\%} episodic pain, {\textgreater} 50{\%} episodic pain, or {\textgreater} 50{\%} constant pain. At follow-up, pain relief was assessed with a standard mail questionnaire; those still having residual pain were further examined in the outpatient clinic or interviewed by phone.

RESULTS: Of the 19 MS patients, 15 were available for follow-up. The median observation period was 55 months (range, 17-99 months). At follow-up, 7 of 15 patients (47{\%}) were completely free of their episodic pain, and an additional 4 (27{\%}) had significant relief of episodic pain (ie, worst pain marked as 0 to 3 cm on a 10-cm visual analog scale). Among the subgroup of 8 patients with a constant pain component, all were free of their constant pain, and 4 (50{\%}) were free of their episodic pain.

CONCLUSION: In our 8-year experience of doing MVD in MS patients with TN, we found complete and significant relief of episodic TN in a large proportion of patients. Even those with a constant pain component before MVD were completely relieved of their constant pain. Thus, in patients with TN (with or without a constant pain component), the presence of MS should not prevent patients from being offered MVD.},

abstract = {Perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) in the central nervous system (CNS) and high levels of myelin autoantigen-reactive T cells in blood and further enriched in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are characteristic for multiple sclerosis (MS) and suggest a role for immunoregulatory cytokines in MS pathogenesis. The difficulties inherent to measurements of cytokine concentrations in body fluids have been partly overcome by adopting techniques allowing cytokine determinations on cellular level. MS is associated with the parallel up-regulation of proinflammatory [interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), lymphotoxin-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-12] and immune response-down-regulating [transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), IL-10] cytokines systemically. A preferential up-modulation of TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha is observed in clinical exacerbations and of TGF-beta and IL-10 in remissions. The B cell-stimulating IL-4 and IL-6 are also up-regulated in MS, as is the cytolysis-promoting perforin. Cytokine production is elevated to an even higher degree in the CSF than systemically, underlining the autonomy of the immune responses in the CSF. All cytokine abnormalities are demonstrable already in very early MS, manifested by acute unilateral optic neuritis associated with more than two MS-like lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging and oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF. The cytokine abnormalities hitherto observed are not MS specific, because they can be found in other inflammatory CNS diseases, e.g., aseptic meningitis and even noninflammatory neurological diseases like stroke. The influence on cytokine profiles, e.g., suppressing proinflammatory cytokines and promoting TGF-beta and IL-10, could be an important way to identify new and promising treatments of MS.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate image classification with computational resource limits at test time. Two such settings are: 1. anytime classification, where the network's prediction for a test example is progressively updated, facilitating the output of a prediction at any time; and 2. budgeted batch classification, where a fixed amount of computation is available to classify a set of examples that can be spent unevenly across "easier" and "harder" inputs. In contrast to most prior work, such as the popular Viola and Jones algorithm, our approach is based on convolutional neural networks. We train multiple classifiers with varying resource demands, which we adaptively apply during test time. To maximally re-use computation between the classifiers, we incorporate them as early-exits into a single deep convolutional neural network and inter-connect them with dense connectivity. To facilitate high quality classification early on, we use a two-dimensional multi-scale network architecture that maintains coarse and fine level features all-throughout the network. Experiments on three image-classification tasks demonstrate that our framework substantially improves the existing state-of-the-art in both settings.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been classically regarded as an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. In recent years, the classification and pathogenesis of the disease have become controversial, particularly with respect to whether an individual patient demonstrates a single or multiple pathogenetic mechanisms in the establishment of the focal plaque of MS. It is also becoming increasingly apparent that there is a significant neurodegenerative component in the disease, involving not only plaques but the non-plaque parenchyma as well. Magnetic resonance imaging, together with histopathologic studies, will continue to shed light on the pathogenesis of these focal and diffuse abnormalities in MS},

abstract = {Previous studies in nonhuman primates and cats have shown that the pulvinar receives input from various cortical and subcortical areas involved in vision. Although the contribution of the pulvinar to human vision remains to be established, anatomical tracer and electrophysiological animal studies on cortico-pulvinar circuits suggest an important role of this structure in visual spatial attention, visual integration, and higher-order visual processing. Because methodological constraints limit investigations of the human pulvinar's function, its role could, up to now, only be inferred from animal studies. In the present study, we used an innovative imaging technique, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography, to determine cortical and subcortical connections of the human pulvinar. We were able to reconstruct pulvinar fiber tracts and compare variability across subjects in vivo. Here we demonstrate that the human pulvinar is interconnected with subcortical structures (superior colliculus, thalamus, and caudate nucleus) as well as with cortical regions (primary visual areas (area 17), secondary visual areas (area 18, 19), visual inferotemporal areas (area 20), posterior parietal association areas (area 7), frontal eye fields and prefrontal areas). These results are consistent with the connectivity reported in animal anatomical studies.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an exciting new MRI modality that can reveal detailed anatomy of the white matter. DTI also allows us to approximate the 3D trajectories of major white matter bundles. By combining the identified tract coordinates with various types of MR parameter maps, such as T2 and diffusion properties, we can perform tract-specific analysis of these parameters. Unfortunately, 3D tract reconstruction is marred by noise, partial volume effects, and complicated axonal structures. Furthermore, changes in diffusion anisotropy under pathological conditions could alter the results of 3D tract reconstruction. In this study, we created a white matter parcellation atlas based on probabilistic maps of 11 major white matter tracts derived from the DTI data from 28 normal subjects. Using these probabilistic maps, automated tract-specific quantification of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were performed. Excellent correlation was found between the automated and the individual tractography-based results. This tool allows efficient initial screening of the status of multiple white matter tracts.},

abstract = {Because acoustic neuromas most frequently arise in the posteriorly placed vestibular nerves, they usually displace the facial and cochlear nerves anteriorly (Figs. 11, 12, and 13). The facial nerve is stretched around the anterior half of the tumor capsule. Variability in the direction of growth of the tumor arising from the vestibular nerves may result in the facial nerve being displaced, not only directly anteriorly, but also anterior-superiorly or anterior-inferiorly. The nerve is infrequently found on the posterior surface of the tumor. Because the facial nerve always enters the facial canal at the anterior-superior quadrant of the lateral margin of the meatus, it is usually easiest to locate it here, rather than at a more medial location where the degree of displacement of the nerve is more variable. The cochlear nerve also lies anterior to the vestibular nerve and is most frequently stretched around the anterior half of the tumor. The strokes of the fine dissecting instruments used in removing the tumor should be directed along the vestibulocochlear nerve from medial to lateral rather than from lateral to medial because traction medially may tear the tiny filaments of the cochlear nerve at the site where these filaments penetrate the lateral end of the meatus to enter the cochlea. The landmarks that are helpful in identifying the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves at the brain stem on the medial side of the tumor have been reviewed. These nerves, although distorted by tumor, can usually be identified on the brain stem side of the tumor at the lateral end of the pontomedullary sulcus, just rostral to the glossopharyngeal nerve and just anterior-superior to the foramen of Luschka, flocculus, and choroid plexus protruding from the foramen of Luschka. After the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves are identified on the medial and lateral sides of the tumor, the final remnants of the tumor are separated from the intervening segment of the nerves. In the three approaches to the meatus and cerebellopontine angle--retrosigmoid, translabyrinthine, and middle fossa--a communication may be established between the subarachnoid space and the mastoid air cells that requires careful closure to prevent a cerebrospinal fluid leak},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To study the morphology of the gyri and sulci of the insular region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined 20 formalin-fixed cerebral hemispheres (10 right and 10 left). Observations described: the peri-insular sulci, anatomical variations in the insular sulci and gyri, and the relationships between the central insular sulcus and the central cerebral sulcus and the anatomy of the insular arteries. RESULTS: Each insula had a trapezoid shape, surrounded by four peri-insular sulci (anterior, superior, posterior, and inferior). We differentiated the posterior peri-insular sulcus from the inferior peri-insular sulcus. These two sulci have two different axes separated by a clear angle. The central insular sulcus divides the insula into two parts. The anterior insula includes three short gyri and the anterior insular pole. The posterior insula includes two long gyri and the posterior insular pole. This structure defines two intra-insular opercula. In 60{\%} of cases, the superior extremity of the central insular sulcus is in direct continuity with the inferior extremity of the cerebral central sulcus. The superior branch of the middle cerebral artery supplies the majority of the anterior insular gyri, and the inferior branch supplies the majority of the posterior insular gyri. CONCLUSIONS: This study details the morphology of each insular structure (gyri, sulci and poles), data which could facilitate surgical access to this deep cortical area and assist in future work correlating anatomy with function.},

Several strategies have been proposed to correct EPI distortions including B0 field mapping (B0M) and image registration. In this study, an experimental framework is proposed to evaluation the performance of different EPI distortion correction methods in improving DT-derived quantities. A deformable registration based method with mutual information metric and cubic B-spline modeled constrained deformation field (BSP) is proposed as an alternative when B0 mapping data are not available. BSP method is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to B0M method using the framework. Both methods can successful reduce EPI distortions and significantly improve the quality of DT-derived quantities. Overall, B0M was clearly superior in infratentorial regions including brainstem and cerebellum, as well as in the ventral areas of the temporal lobes while BSP was better in all rostral brain regions.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Microvascular decompression has become an accepted surgical technique for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and other cranial nerve rhizopathies. The senior author (P.J.J.) began performing this procedure in 1969 and has performed more than 4400 operations. The purpose of this article is to review some of the nuances of the technical aspects of this procedure.

METHODS: A review of 4415 operations shows that numerous modifications to the technique of microvascular decompression have occurred during the last 29 years. Of the 2420 operations performed for trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia before 1990, cerebellar injury occurred in 21 cases (0.87{\%}), hearing loss in 48 (1.98{\%}), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in 59 cases (2.44{\%}). Of the 1995 operations performed since 1990, cerebellar injuries declined to nine cases (0.45{\%}), hearing loss to 16 (0.8{\%}), and CSF leakage to 37 (1.85{\%} p {\textless} 0.01, test for equality of distributions). The authors describe slight variations made to maximize surgical exposure and minimize potential complications in each of the six principal steps of this operation. These modifications have led to decreasing complication rates in recent years.

CONCLUSIONS: Using the techniques described in this report, microvascular decompression is an extremely safe and effective treatment for many cranial nerve rhizopathies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surface-rendered three-dimensional (3D) 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is useful for presurgical simulation of microvascular decompression. This study compared the sensitivity and specificity of 1.5- and 3.0-T surface-rendered 3D MR imaging for preoperative identification of the compression vessels of trigeminal neuralgia. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients underwent microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia. Forty and 60 patients were evaluated by 1.5- and 3.0-T MR imaging, respectively. Three-dimensional MR images were constructed on the basis of MR imaging, angiography, and venography data and evaluated to determine the compression vessel before surgery. MR imaging findings were compared with the microsurgical findings to compare the sensitivity and specificity of 1.5- and 3.0-T MR imaging. RESULTS: The agreement between MR imaging and surgical findings depended on the compression vessels. For superior cerebellar artery, 1.5- and 3.0-T MR imaging had 84.4{\%} and 82.7{\%} sensitivity and 100{\%} and 100{\%} specificity, respectively. For anterior inferior cerebellar artery, 1.5- and 3.0-T MR imaging had 33.3{\%} and 50{\%} sensitivity and 92.9{\%} and 95{\%} specificity, respectively. For the petrosal vein, 1.5- and 3.0-T MR imaging had 75{\%} and 64.3{\%} sensitivity and 79.2{\%} and 78.1{\%} specificity, respectively. Complete pain relief was obtained in 36 of 40 and 55 of 60 patients undergoing 1.5- and 3.0-T MR imaging, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that both 1.5- and 3.0-T MR imaging provided high sensitivity and specificity for preoperative assessment of the compression vessels of trigeminal neuralgia. Preoperative 3D imaging provided very high quality presurgical simulation, resulting in excellent clinical outcomes},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Sex-related influences on pain and analgesia have become a topic of tremendous scientific and clinical interest, especially in the last 10 to 15 years. Members of our research group published reviews of this literature more than a decade ago, and the intervening time period has witnessed robust growth in research regarding sex, gender, and pain. Therefore, it seems timely to revisit this literature. Abundant evidence from recent epidemiologic studies clearly demonstrates that women are at substantially greater risk for many clinical pain conditions, and there is some suggestion that postoperative and procedural pain may be more severe among women than men. Consistent with our previous reviews, current human findings regarding sex differences in experimental pain indicate greater pain sensitivity among females compared with males for most pain modalities, including more recently implemented clinically relevant pain models such as temporal summation of pain and intramuscular injection of algesic substances. The evidence regarding sex differences in laboratory measures of endogenous pain modulation is mixed, as are findings from studies using functional brain imaging to ascertain sex differences in pain-related cerebral activation. Also inconsistent are findings regarding sex differences in responses to pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic pain treatments. The article concludes with a discussion of potential biopsychosocial mechanisms that may underlie sex differences in pain, and considerations for future research are discussed. PERSPECTIVE: This article reviews the recent literature regarding sex, gender, and pain. The growing body of evidence that has accumulated in the past 10 to 15 years continues to indicate substantial sex differences in clinical and experimental pain responses, and some evidence suggests that pain treatment responses may differ for women versus men.},

abstract = {Measurement of changes in brain cortical thickness is useful for the assessment of regional gray matter atrophy in neurodegenerative conditions. A new longitudinal method, called CLADA (cortical longitudinal atrophy detection algorithm), has been developed for the measurement of changes in cortical thickness in magnetic resonance images (MRI) acquired over time. CLADA creates a subject-specific cortical model which is longitudinally deformed to match images from individual time points. The algorithm was designed to work reliably for lower resolution images, such as the MRIs with 1×1×5mm(3) voxels previously acquired for many clinical trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). CLADA was evaluated to determine reproducibility, accuracy, and sensitivity. Scan-rescan variability was 0.45{\%} for images with 1mm(3) isotropic voxels and 0.77{\%} for images with 1×1×5mm(3) voxels. The mean absolute accuracy error was 0.43mm, as determined by comparison of CLADA measurements to cortical thickness measured directly in post-mortem tissue. CLADA's sensitivity for correctly detecting at least 0.1mm change was 86{\%} in a simulation study. A comparison to FreeSurfer showed good agreement (Pearson correlation=0.73 for global mean thickness). CLADA was also applied to MRIs acquired over 18months in secondary progressive MS patients who were imaged at two different resolutions. Cortical thinning was detected in this group in both the lower and higher resolution images. CLADA detected a higher rate of cortical thinning in MS patients compared to healthy controls over 2years. These results show that CLADA can be used for reliable measurement of cortical atrophy in longitudinal studies, even in lower resolution images.},

abstract = {The human trigeminal system mediates facial pain and somatosensory processing. The anatomic location of neuronal substrates and axonal pathways of the trigeminal system have previously been characterized with conventional in vitro methods. The present investigation implemented diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography to first segment the peripheral trigeminal circuitry, trigeminal nerve branches (ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular nerves), ganglion, and nerve root. Subsequent segmentations involved the spinal trigeminal and trigeminal thalamic tracts, which respectively convey information to the spinal trigeminal nuclei and ventral thalamic regions. This latter procedure also identified 1) spinal thalamic (anterolateral [AL]) system pathways (propagating pain and temperature information from the body), 2) trigeminal lemniscus (TL; touch and face position), and 3) medial lemniscus (ML; touch and limb position). The anatomic location of the identified pain and somatosensory pathways compared well with previous functional findings in the human trigeminal system, as well as the tract position in human histological cross sections. Probabilistic tractography may be a useful method to further comprehend the functional and structural properties of trigeminal and other related systems. Application of DTI to map pain and somatosensory pathways in conjunction with a characterization of function properties of pain and somatosensory processing would further define the systematic changes that occur in trigeminal pathology.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This research was designed to test the hypothesis that presurgery "catastrophizing" would predict postsurgical pain and postsurgical analgesic consumption. METHODS: A sample of 48 individuals who underwent anterior cruciate ligament repair participated in the study. All participants completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (described by Sullivan et al in 1995) prior to surgery. Measures of pain (pain scores on a scale of 0-10) were obtained in the postanesthetic care unit, as well as 1, 2, and 7 days after surgery. Opioid and nonopioid analgesic consumption was tabulated while patients were in the hospital and after discharge. RESULTS: Results showed that the Pain Catastrophizing Scale was a significant predictor of acute postsurgical pain in the postanesthetic care unit (r = 0.48, P = 0.004 for maximum pain in the postanesthetic care unit). Maximum pain ratings in patients with high Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores ({\textgreater} median of 13) were 33{\%} to 74{\%} higher numerically than in patients with low Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores ({\textless} or = median), and the duration of moderate-severe pain ({\textgreater}3/10) was more prolonged (45 minutes versus 28 minutes in patients with high and low Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). The Pain Catastrophizing Scale was also predictive of pain with activity at 24 hours (r = 0.65 for pain on walking, P {\textless} or = 0.0001). The Pain Catastrophizing Scale did not predict postoperative analgesic use. CONCLUSION: The pattern of findings suggests that high catastrophizing scores may be a risk factor for heightened pain following surgery. Clinical and theoretical implications of the findings are addressed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have shown a reduction of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs) in elderly adults compared with younger adults. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the developmental course of DNIC deficits and so it is still unclear whether middle-aged adults also show a DNIC deficit. The aims of the present study were to better characterize the developmental time course of the change in DNIC response by adding a middle-aged group. The role of expectations was also investigated. METHODS: The pain thresholds (PTs) of 20 young, 20 middle-aged, and 20 healthy elderly volunteers were assessed before and during a cold pressor task (water at 7 degrees C). Acute nociceptive stimuli were administered using a thermode and consisted of a range of painless and painful heat pulses. RESULTS: Analyses showed that thermal PTs increase by middle age but that the DNIC-induced increase in PT dampens progressively with advancing age. DNIC response was negatively correlated with advancing age, however, expectations regarding DNIC efficacy did not vary with age. This suggests that age-related changes in the size of the DNIC response are not best explained by an age-related change in expectation. DISCUSSION: The findings tell us that changes in pain perception and endogenous pain modulation arrive earlier than previously suggested. Studies on aging and pain should include a middle-aged group when comparing pain measures across the adult lifespan},

abstract = {Since its development about 15 years ago, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the leading research tool for mapping brain activity. The technique works by detecting the levels of oxygen in the blood, point by point, throughout the brain. In other words, it relies on a surrogate signal, resulting from changes in oxygenation, blood volume and flow, and does not directly measure neural activity. Although a relationship between changes in brain activity and blood flow has long been speculated, indirectly examined and suggested and surely anticipated and expected, the neural basis of the fMRI signal was only recently demonstrated directly in experiments using combined imaging and intracortical recordings. In the present paper, we discuss the results obtained from such combined experiments. We also discuss our current knowledge of the extracellularly measured signals of the neural processes that they represent and of the structural and functional neurovascular coupling, which links such processes with the hemodynamic changes that offer the surrogate signal that we use to map brain activity. We conclude by considering applications of invasive MRI, including injections of paramagnetic tracers for the study of connectivity in the living animal and simultaneous imaging and electrical microstimulation.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising method for characterizing microstructural changes or differences with neuropathology and treatment. The diffusion tensor may be used to characterize the magnitude, the degree of anisotropy, and the orientation of directional diffusion. This review addresses the biological mechanisms, acquisition, and analysis of DTI measurements. The relationships between DTI measures and white matter pathologic features (e.g., ischemia, myelination, axonal damage, inflammation, and edema) are summarized. Applications of DTI to tissue characterization in neurotherapeutic applications are reviewed. The interpretations of common DTI measures (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional anisotropy, FA; radial diffusivity, D(r); and axial diffusivity, D(a)) are discussed. In particular, FA is highly sensitive to microstructural changes, but not very specific to the type of changes (e.g., radial or axial). To maximize the specificity and better characterize the tissue microstructure, future studies should use multiple diffusion tensor measures (e.g., MD and FA, or D(a) and D(r))},

We describe an optimized method of VBM to examine the effects of age on grey and white matter and CSF in 465 normal adults. Global grey matter volume decreased linearly with age, with a significantly steeper decline in males. Local areas of accelerated loss were observed bilaterally in the insula, superior parietal gyri, central sulci, and cingulate sulci. Areas exhibiting little or no age effect (relative preservation) were noted in the amygdala, hippocampi, and entorhinal cortex. Global white matter did not decline with age, but local areas of relative accelerated loss and preservation were seen. There was no interaction of age with sex for regionally specific effects. These results corroborate previous reports and indicate that VBM is a useful technique for studying structural brain correlates of ageing through life in humans.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based volumetric measurements of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures can discriminate between normal elderly control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) of moderate to advanced severity. In terms of clinical utility, however, a more important issue concerns the ability of the technique to differentiate between normal elderly control subjects and AD patients with the very mildest form of the disease. We performed MRI-based volumetric measurements of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala in 126 cognitively normal elderly control subjects and 94 patients with probable AD. The diagnosis of AD was made according to NINDS/ADRDA criteria, and disease severity was categorized by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Patients with CDR 0.5 were classified as very mild, CDR 1 as mild, and CDR 2 as moderate disease severity. Volumes of each structure declined with increasing age in control subjects and did so in parallel for men and women. The volume of each measured MTL structure also declined with age in patients with AD. The volume of each MTL structure was significantly smaller in AD patients than control subjects (p {\textless} 0.001). Of the several MTL measures, the total hippocampal volumetric measurements were best at discriminating control subjects from AD patients. The mean hippocampal volumes for AD patients relative to control subjects by severity of disease were as follows: very mild AD (CDR 0.5) -1.75 SD below the control mean, mild AD (CDR 1) -1.99 SD, and moderate AD (CDR 2) -2.22 SD. Age- and gender-adjusted, normalized MRI-based hippocampal volumetric measurements provide a sensitive marker of the MTL neuroanatomic degeneration in AD early in the disease process.},

Twenty CN older adults underwent lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging within a few days of each other. Analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data involved a priori region of interest and voxelwise approaches. The region of interest results revealed a positive correlation between CSF measures of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$42/p-Tau181) and WM integrity in the fornix, a relationship which persisted after controlling for hippocampal volume and fornix volume. Lower WM integrity in the same portion of the fornix was also associated with reduced performance on the Digit Symbol test. Subsequent exploratory voxelwise analyses indicated a positive correlation between CSF A$\beta$42/p-Tau181 and WM integrity in bilateral portions of the fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and in the corpus callosum and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Our results link lower WM microstructural integrity in CN older adults with CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and suggest that this association in the fornix may be independent of volumetric measures.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the functional and structural substrates of cognitive network changes in patients with benign multiple sclerosis (BMS), using an analysis of effective connectivity and MR tractography. Using a 3-Tesla scanner, we acquired dual-echo, diffusion tensor (DT) and functional MRI during the performance of the Stroop task from 15 BMS patients and 19 healthy controls. DT MRI tractography was used to calculate DT derived metrics from several white matter (WM) fiber bundles, thought to be involved in cognitive performance. DT MRI metrics from WM fiber bundles not directly related with cognitive performance were also derived. Effective connectivity analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping. MS patients had significantly abnormal DT MRI metrics in all the structures analyzed. Compared with controls, MS patients had more significant activations of several areas of the cognitive network involved in Stroop performance, bilaterally. Compared with controls, BMS patients also had increased connectivity strengths between several cortical areas of the sensorimotor network and the right (R) inferior frontal gyrus and the R cerebellum, as well as decreased connectivity strengths with the anterior cingulate cortex. Coefficients of altered connectivity were moderately correlated with structural MRI metrics of tissue damage within intra- and inter-hemispheric cognitive-related WM fiber bundles, while no correlations were found with the remaining fiber bundles studied, suggesting that functional cortical changes in patients with BMS might represent an adaptive response driven by damage of specific WM structures.

abstract = {A quarter of century ago, Farwell and Donchin (1988) described their mental prosthesis for "talking off the top of your head." This innovative communication system, later named P3-speller, has been the most investigated and tested brain-computer interface (BCI) system, to date. A main goal of the research on P3-spellers was the development of an effective assistive device for patients with severe motor diseases. Among these patients are those affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS patients have become a target population in P3-speller (and more generally in BCI) research. The P3-speller relies on the visual sensory modality, and it can be controlled by requiring users to actively move their eyes. Unfortunately, eye-movement control is usually not spared in the last stages of ALS, and, then, it is definitively lost in the case of complete paralysis. We reviewed the literature on ALS patients tested by means of P3-speller systems. Our aim was to investigate the evidence available to date of the P3-spellers effectiveness in ALS patients. To address this goal, a meta-analytic approach was adopted. The pooled classification accuracy performance, among retrieved studies, was about 74{\%}. This estimation, however, was affected by significant heterogeneity and inconsistency among studies. This fact makes this percentage estimation (i.e., 74{\%}) unreliable. Nowadays, the conclusion is that the initial hopes posed on P3-speller for ALS patients have not been met yet. In addition, no trials in which the P3-speller has been compared to current assistive technologies for communication (e.g., eye-trackers) are available. In conclusion, further studies are required to obtain a reliable index of P3-speller effectiveness in ALS. Furthermore, comparisons of P3-speller systems with the available assistive technologies are needed to assess the P3-speller usefulness with non-completely paralyzed ALS-patients.},

abstract = {Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non-disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.},

abstract = {Subjective sensory experiences are constructed by the integration of afferent sensory information with information about the uniquely personal internal cognitive state. The insular cortex is anatomically positioned to serve as one potential interface between afferent processing mechanisms and more cognitively oriented modulatory systems. However, the role of the insular cortex in such modulatory processes remains poorly understood. Two individuals with extensive lesions to the insula were examined to better understand the contribution of this brain region to the generation of subjective sensory experiences. Despite substantial differences in the extent of the damage to the insular cortex, three findings were common to both individuals. First, both subjects had substantially higher pain intensity ratings of acute experimental noxious stimuli than age-matched control subjects. Second, when pain-related activation of the primary somatosensory cortex was examined during left- and right-sided stimulation, both individuals exhibited dramatically elevated activity of the primary somatosensory cortex ipsilateral to the lesioned insula in relation to healthy control subjects. Finally, both individuals retained the ability to evaluate pain despite substantial insular damage and no evidence of detectable insular activity. Together, these results indicate that the insula may be importantly involved in tuning cortical regions to appropriately use previous cognitive information during afferent processing. Finally, these data suggest that a subjectively available experience of pain can be instantiated by brain mechanisms that do not require the insular cortex.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new model for extracting an interpretable sentence embedding by introducing self-attention. Instead of using a vector, we use a 2-D matrix to represent the embedding, with each row of the matrix attending on a different part of the sentence. We also propose a self-attention mechanism and a special regularization term for the model. As a side effect, the embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the sentence are encoded into the embedding. We evaluate our model on 3 different tasks: author profiling, sentiment classification, and textual entailment. Results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to other sentence embedding methods in all of the 3 tasks.},

The output is a 3-D volume of isotropic high resolution. The inversion process resembles a localized projection reconstruction problem. Iterative algorithms for reconstruction are based on the Projection onto Convex Sets (POCS) formalism.

abstract = {Fiber tractography (FT), which aims to reconstruct the three-dimensional trajectories of white matter (WM) fibers non-invasively, is one of the most popular approaches for analyzing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data given its high inter- and intra-rater reliability and scan-rescan reproducibility. The major disadvantage of manual FT segmentations, unfortunately, is that placing regions-of-interest for tract selection can be very labor-intensive and time-consuming. Although there are several methods that can identify specific WM fiber bundles in an automated way, manual FT segmentations across multiple subjects performed by a trained rater with neuroanatomical expertise are generally assumed to be more accurate. However, for longitudinal DTI analyses it may still be beneficial to automate the FT segmentation across multiple time points, but then for each individual subject separately. Both the inter-subject and intra-subject automation in this situation are intended for subjects without gross pathology. In this work, we propose such an automated longitudinal intra-subject analysis (dubbed ALISA) approach, and assessed whether ALISA could preserve the same level of reliability as obtained with manual FT segmentations. In addition, we compared ALISA with an automated inter-. subject analysis. Based on DTI data sets from (i) ten healthy subjects that were scanned five times (six-month intervals, aged 7.6-8.6. years at the first scan) and (ii) one control subject that was scanned ten times (weekly intervals, 12.2. years at the first scan), we demonstrate that the increased efficiency provided by ALISA does not compromise the high degrees of precision and accuracy that can be achieved with manual FT segmentations. Further automation for inter-. subject analyses, however, did not provide similarly accurate FT segmentations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Given reports of gray matter differences in meditators as well as between chronic pain patients and controls, the present study investigated whether differences in brain morphometry are associated with the low pain sensitivity observed in Zen practitioners. Structural MRI scans were performed and the temperature required to produce moderate pain was assessed in 17 meditators and 18 controls. Meditators had significantly lower pain sensitivity than controls. Assessed across all subjects, lower pain sensitivity was associated with thicker cortex in affective, pain-related brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus and anterior insula. Comparing groups, meditators were found to have thicker cortex in the dorsal anterior cingulate and bilaterally in secondary somatosensory cortex. More years of meditation experience was associated with thicker gray matter in the anterior cingulate, and hours of experience predicted more gray matter bilaterally in the lower leg area of the primary somatosensory cortex as well as the hand area in the right hemisphere. Results generally suggest that pain sensitivity is related to cortical thickness in pain-related brain regions and that the lower sensitivity observed in meditators may be the product of alterations to brain morphometry from long-term practice},

abstract = {Skilled spoken language production requires fast and accurate coordination of up to 100 muscles. A long-standing concept--tracing ultimately back to Paul Broca--assumes posterior parts of the inferior frontal gyrus to support the orchestration of the respective movement sequences prior to innervation of the vocal tract. At variance with this tradition, the insula has more recently been declared the relevant "region for coordinating speech articulation", based upon clinico-neuroradiological correlation studies. However, these findings have been criticized on methodological grounds. A survey of the clinical literature (cerebrovascular disorders, brain tumours, stimulation mapping) yields a still inconclusive picture. By contrast, functional imaging studies report more consistently hemodynamic insular responses in association with motor aspects of spoken language. Most noteworthy, a relatively small area at the junction of insular and opercular cortex was found sensitive to the phonetic-linguistic structure of verbal utterances, a strong argument for its engagement in articulatory control processes. Nevertheless, intrasylvian hemodynamic activation does not appear restricted to articulatory processes and might also be engaged in the adjustment of the autonomic system to ventilatory needs during speech production: Whereas the posterior insula could be involved in the cortical representation of respiration-related metabolic (interoceptive) states, the more rostral components, acting upon autonomic functions, might serve as a corollary pathway to "voluntary control of breathing" bound to corticospinal and -bulbar fiber tracts. For example, the insula could participate in the implementation of task-specific autonomic settings such as the maintenance of a state of relative hyperventilation during speech production.},

After the models of bundles have been learned from training data without supervision, they can be used as priors to cluster/classify fibers of new subjects for comparison across subjects. When clustering fibers of new subjects, new clusters can be created for structures not observed in the training data. Our approach does not require computing pairwise distances between fibers and can cluster a huge set of fibers across multiple subjects.

Here we investigate the role of adult structural plasticity in the complex, long-term learning process of foreign language acquisition. We collected monthly diffusion tensor imaging scans of 11 English speakers who took a 9-month intensive course in written and spoken Modern Standard Chinese as well as from 16 control participants who did not study a language. We show that white matter reorganizes progressively across multiple sites as adults study a new language. Language learners exhibited progressive changes in white matter tracts associated with traditional left hemisphere language areas and their right hemisphere analogs. Surprisingly, the most significant changes occurred in frontal lobe tracts crossing the genu of the corpus callosum-a region not generally included in current neural models of language processing. These results indicate that plasticity of white matter plays an important role in adult language learning and additionally demonstrate the potential of longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging as a new tool to yield insights into cognitive processes.},

This study investigated in vivo the optic radiations in patients affected by optic neuritis using fast marching tractography (FMT), a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fiber tracking method, and group mapping techniques, which allow statistical comparisons between subjects. Seven patients, 1 year after isolated unilateral optic neuritis, and ten age and gender-matched controls underwent whole-brain diffusion tensor MR imaging. The FMT algorithm was used to generate voxel-scale connectivity (VSC) maps in the optic radiations in each subject in native space. Group maps of the left and right optic radiations were created in the patient and control group in a standardized reference frame using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). The reconstructed optic radiations in the patient group were localized more laterally in the posterior part of the tracts and more inferiorly than in the control group. Patients showed reduced VSC values in both tracts compared with controls. These findings suggest that the group mapping techniques might be used to assess changes in the optic radiations in patients after an episode of optic neuritis.

abstract = {In this conceptual review, we highlight our strategy for, and progress in the development of corticospinal neuroprostheses for restoring locomotor functions and promoting neural repair after thoracic spinal cord injury in experimental animal models. We specifically focus on recent developments in recording and stimulating neural interfaces, decoding algorithms, extraction of real-time feedback information, and closed-loop control systems. Each of these complex neurotechnologies plays a significant role for the design of corticospinal neuroprostheses. Even more challenging is the coordinated integration of such multifaceted technologies into effective and practical neuroprosthetic systems to improve movement execution, and augment neural plasticity after injury. In this review we address our progress in rodent animal models to explore the viability of a technology-intensive strategy for recovery and repair of the damaged nervous system. The technical, practical, and regulatory hurdles that lie ahead along the path toward clinical applications are enormous - and their resolution is uncertain at this stage. However, it is imperative that the discoveries and technological developments being made across the field of neuroprosthetics do not stay in the lab, but instead reach clinical fruition at the fastest pace possible. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

abstract = {Mushroom bodies are a well-known site for associative learning in insects. Yet the precise mechanisms that underlie plasticity there and ensure their specificity remain elusive. In locusts, the synapses between the intrinsic mushroom body neurons and their postsynaptic targets obey a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. Although this property homeostatically regulates the timing of mushroom body output, its potential role in associative learning is unknown. Here we show in vivo that pre-post pairing causing STDP can, when followed by the local delivery of a reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator, specify the synapses that will undergo an associative change. At these synapses, and there only, the change is a transformation of the STDP rule itself. These results illustrate the multiple actions of STDP, including a role in associative learning, despite potential temporal dissociation between the pairings that specify synaptic modification and the delivery of reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator signals.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the central processing of dynamic mechanical allodynia in patients with mononeuropathy. Regional cerebral blood flow, as an indicator of neuronal activity, was measured with positron emission tomography. Paired comparisons were made between three different states; rest, allodynia during brushing the painful skin area, and brushing of the homologous contralateral area. Bilateral activations were observed in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) during allodynia compared to rest. The S1 activation contralateral to the site of the stimulus was more expressed during allodynia than during innocuous touch. Significant activations of the contralateral posterior parietal cortex, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the thalamus bilaterally and motor areas were also observed in the allodynic state compared to both non-allodynic states. In the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) there was only a suggested activation when the allodynic state was compared with the non-allodynic states. In order to account for the individual variability in the intensity of allodynia and ongoing spontaneous pain, rCBF was regressed on the individually reported pain intensity, and significant covariations were observed in the ACC and the right anterior insula. Significantly decreased regional blood flow was observed bilaterally in the medial and lateral temporal lobe as well as in the occipital and posterior cingulate cortices when the allodynic state was compared to the non-painful conditions. This finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting attentional modulation and a central coping strategy for known and expected painful stimuli. Involvement of the medial pain system has previously been reported in patients with mononeuropathy during ongoing spontaneous pain. This study reveals a bilateral activation of the lateral pain system as well as involvement of the medial pain system during dynamic mechanical allodynia in patients with mononeuropathy.},

Clinical characteristics include: delayed onset of pain after nervous system lesion, pain in area of sensory loss, spontaneous and different evoked types of pains. It has so far only been possible to classify these pains on basis of underlying cause or on anatomical location. The mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain are not yet clear, but neuronal hyperexcitability in those neurons that have lost their normal patterned input seems to be a common denominator for many, if not all types, of neuropathic pains. Along these lines, a mechanism-based classification has recently been proposed, which is an attractive approach because it provides a frame for a rationally based therapy of neuropathic pains.

A later recovery starts at about 6-7 weeks and finishes at about 10-11 weeks. The remyelination has been monitored in the electron microscope by measurement of the myelin thickness and axon diameter of the large fibers. The remyelination follows a time course similar to the late phase of conduction recovery. By reference to the work of others, we surmise that the early recovery of conduction is due to the reorganization of microtubules disorganized by the pressure},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The limbic system, relevant to memory and emotion, is an interesting subject of study in healthy and diseased individuals. It consists of a network of gray matter structures interconnected by white matter fibers. Although gray matter components of this system have been studied by using MR imaging, the connecting fibers have not been analyzed to the same degree. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal intensity contamination of the fornix and cingulum, the 2 major white matter tracts of the limbic system, can alter diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) measurements and affect tractography. We investigated the effect of CSF signal intensity suppression on fiber tracking of the limbic connections and characterized the diffusion properties of these structures in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Nine healthy individuals were scanned with standard and CSF-suppressed DTI. Tractography of the fornix and cingulum was performed for both acquisition methods. We report mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy measurements of the crus, body, and columns of the fornix, and descending, superior, and anterior portions of the cingulum. RESULTS: Diffusion measurements were improved and tractography was facilitated by using CSF-suppressed DTI. In particular, tract volume increased, whereas decreases of the mean diffusivity and increases of diffusion anisotropy more accurately represented the underlying tissue by minimizing deleterious partial volume averaging from CSF. This was particularly true for the fornix because it is in closest contact to CSF. Diffusion measurements throughout the limbic connections were consistent in healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: We recommend the use of CSF suppression when performing diffusion-tensor tractography of the limbic system.},

Despite the widespread use of cortical folding patterns to perform ad hoc estimations of the locations of the BAs, little is understood regarding 1) how variable the position of a given BA is with respect to the folds, 2) whether the location of some BAs is more variable than others, and 3) whether the variability is related to the level of a BA in a putative cortical hierarchy. We use whole-brain histology of 10 postmortem human brains and surface-based analysis to test how well the folds predict the locations of the BAs. We show that higher order cortical areas exhibit more variability than primary and secondary areas and that the folds are much better predictors of the BAs than had been previously thought. These results further highlight the significance of cortical folding patterns and suggest a common mechanism for the development of the folds and the cytoarchitectonic fields.},

Previous work primarily utilized feature-based pipeline models to process this task. Many efforts need to be made on feature engineering when feature-based models are employed. Moreover, pipeline models may suffer error propagation and are not able to utilize the interactions between subtasks. Therefore, we propose a neural joint model to extract biomedical entities as well as their relations simultaneously, and it can alleviate the problems above. Our model was evaluated on two tasks, i.e., the task of extracting adverse drug events between drug and disease entities, and the task of extracting resident relations between bacteria and location entities. Compared with the state-of-the-art systems in these tasks, our model improved the F1 scores of the first task by 5.1{\%} in entity recognition and 8.0{\%} in relation extraction, and that of the second task by 9.2{\%} in relation extraction. The proposed model achieves competitive performances with less work on feature engineering. We demonstrate that the model based on neural networks is effective for biomedical entity and relation extraction. In addition, parameter sharing is an alternative method for neural models to jointly process this task. Our work can facilitate the research on biomedical text mining.},

In this work, we propose a novel application of deep networks to learn features over multiple modalities.

In particular, we demonstrate cross modality feature learning, where better features for one modality (e.g., video) can be learned ifmultiple modalities (e.g., audio and video) are present at feature learning time. Furthermore, we show how to learn a shared representation between modalities and evalu- ate it on a unique task, where the classifier is trained with audio-only data but tested with video-only data and vice-versa. Our mod- els are validated on the CUAVE and AVLet- ters datasets on audio-visual speech classifi- cation, demonstrating best published visual speech classification on AVLetters and effec- tive shared representation learning.},

Different cognitive tasks employ distinctive white matter fiber bundles. The temporal lobe and its projections subserve a variety of key functions known to deteriorate during aging. In a cohort of 52 healthy subjects (ages 25-82 years), we performed voxel-wise regression analysis correlating performance in higher-order cognitive domains (executive function, information processing speed, and memory) with white matter integrity, as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tracking in the temporal lobe projections [uncinate fasciculus (UF), fornix, cingulum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF)]. The fiber tracts were spatially registered and statistical parametric maps were produced to spatially localize the significant correlations. Results showed that performance in the executive function domain is correlated with DTI parameters in the left SLF and right UF; performance in the information processing speed domain is correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left cingulum, left fornix, right and left ILF and SLF; and the memory domain shows significant correlations with DTI parameters in the right fornix, right cingulum, left ILF, left SLF and right UF. These findings suggest that DTI tractography enables anatomical definition of region of interest (ROI) for correlation of behavioral parameters with diffusion indices, and functionality can be correlated with white matter integrity.},

abstract = {Upon receipt in the dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord, nociceptive (pain-signalling) information from the viscera, skin and other organs is subject to extensive processing by a diversity of mechanisms, certain of which enhance, and certain of which inhibit, its transfer to higher centres. In this regard, a network of descending pathways projecting from cerebral structures to the DH plays a complex and crucial role. Specific centrifugal pathways either suppress (descending inhibition) or potentiate (descending facilitation) passage of nociceptive messages to the brain. Engagement of descending inhibition by the opioid analgesic, morphine, fulfils an important role in its pain-relieving properties, while induction of analgesia by the adrenergic agonist, clonidine, reflects actions at alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (alpha(2)-ARs) in the DH normally recruited by descending pathways. However, opioids and adrenergic agents exploit but a tiny fraction of the vast panoply of mechanisms now known to be involved in the induction and/or expression of descending controls. For example, no drug interfering with descending facilitation is currently available for clinical use. The present review focuses on: (1) the organisation of descending pathways and their pathophysiological significance; (2) the role of individual transmitters and specific receptor types in the modulation and expression of mechanisms of descending inhibition and facilitation and (3) the advantages and limitations of established and innovative analgesic strategies which act by manipulation of descending controls. Knowledge of descending pathways has increased exponentially in recent years, so this is an opportune moment to survey their operation and therapeutic relevance to the improved management of pain.},

abstract = {The insula plays a key role in brain processing of noxious and innocuous thermal stimuli. The anterior and the posterior portions of the insular cortex are involved in different ways in nociceptive and thermoceptive processing. Therefore, their stimulus-specific functional connectivity may also differ. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the activity and functional connectivity of insular cortex subregions during noxious and innocuous thermal stimulation. In 11 healthy subjects, psychophysically controlled noxious and innocuous warm and cold stimuli were applied to the left forearm. To differentiate between the subregions of the insular cortex involved in pain processing and those involved in temperature processing, a 2×2 factorial fMRI analysis was performed. Pain processing insular areas (main effect of pain) were detected in bilateral aINS and contralateral pINS. Temperature processing insular areas (main effect of temperature) were also found in bilateral aINS and contralateral pINS. The individual signal time courses from the pain- and temperature processing insular activation clusters were used for calculation and comparison of stimulus-specific functional connectivity of aINS and pINS by means of a correlation analysis. As expected, both aINS and pINS were functionally connected to a large brain network - which predominantly includes areas involved in nociception and thermoception: primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices, cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal association cortices (PA). When statistically compared, during both noxious and innocuous stimulation, aINS was more strongly connected to PFC and to ACC than was pINS; pINS meanwhile was more strongly connected to S1 and to the primary motor cortex (M1). Interestingly, S2 was more strongly connected to aINS than to pINS during painful stimulation but not during innocuous thermal stimulation. We conclude that aINS is more strongly functionally connected to areas known for affective and cognitive processing, whereas pINS is more strongly connected with areas known for sensory-discriminative processing of noxious and somatosensory stimuli.},

abstract = {We present a technique for automatically assigning a neuroanatomical label to each voxel in an MRI volume based on probabilistic information automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set. In contrast to existing segmentation procedures that only label a small number of tissue classes, the current method assigns one of 37 labels to each voxel, including left and right caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, lateral ventricles, hippocampus, and amygdala. The classification technique employs a registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases and aging. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling, and of sufficient sensitivity to robustly detect changes in the volume of noncortical structures that presage the onset of probable Alzheimer's disease.},

@article{Marinkovic2009,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Detailed ultrastructural and immunohistochemical examination of the trigeminal axons surrounded by the peripheral type of the myelin could add new information about the extent of the trigeminal nerve lesion in neuralgia.

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: The examination comprised, firstly, the 10 trigeminal nerve roots (TNRs) in which the neurovascular contact was found in 20{\%} of the cases, and the 2 additional control TNRs. Secondly, the biopsy specimens were taken from 6 patients with trigeminal neuralgia and 2 patients with trigeminal neuropathy following a partial TNR rhizotomy. The specimens were examined under the electron microscope (EM) and/or using the immunohistochemical (IHC) methods.

RESULTS: In addition to the central zone of demyelination, the EM examination of the TNR also revealed alterations of the peripheral myelin, i.e. deformation, thickening, demyelination and remyelination, as well as changes of the peripheral axons, that is, atrophy or hypertrophy, neurofilaments increase, loss of the myelin and sprouting occasionally. Some Schwann cells were also damaged. The IHC examination usually showed a moderate immune reaction against neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), but sporadically weaker reaction against the S-100 protein, synaptophysin (SY), neurofilament protein (NFP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity was weak at some sites, but strong at some other places.

CONCLUSIONS: The pathological changes affect not only the central nerve fibers of the TNR, but also some of the peripheral axons, their myelin sheath and Schwann cells. These are signs of the retrograde ultrastructural and biochemical alterations, which could participate in the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the trigeminal neuralgia.},

abstract = {Cortical surface mapping has been widely used to compensate for individual variability of cortical shape and topology in anatomical and functional studies. While many surface mapping methods were proposed based on landmarks, curves, spherical or native cortical coordinates, few studies have extensively and quantitatively evaluated surface mapping methods across different methodologies. In this study we compared five cortical surface mapping algorithms, including large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) for curves (LDDMM-curve), for surfaces (LDDMM-surface), multi-manifold LDDMM (MM-LDDMM), FreeSurfer, and CARET, using 40 MRI scans and 10 simulated datasets. We computed curve variation errors and surface alignment consistency for assessing the mapping accuracy of local cortical features (e.g., gyral/sulcal curves and sulcal regions) and the curvature correlation for measuring the mapping accuracy in terms of overall cortical shape. In addition, the simulated datasets facilitated the investigation of mapping error distribution over the cortical surface when the MM-LDDMM, FreeSurfer, and CARET mapping algorithms were applied. Our results revealed that the LDDMM-curve, MM-LDDMM, and CARET approaches best aligned the local curve features with their own curves. The MM-LDDMM approach was also found to be the best in aligning the local regions and cortical folding patterns (e.g., curvature) as compared to the other mapping approaches. The simulation experiment showed that the MM-LDDMM mapping yielded less local and global deformation errors than the CARET and FreeSurfer mappings. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Neural mechanisms mediating the transition from acute to chronic pain remain largely unknown. In a longitudinal brain imaging study, we followed up patients with a single sub-acute back pain (SBP) episode for more than 1year as their pain recovered (SBPr), or persisted (SBPp) representing a transition to chronic pain. We discovered brain white matter structural abnormalities (n=24 SBP patients; SBPp=12 and SBPr=12), as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), at entry into the study in SBPp in comparison to SBPr. These white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) differences accurately predicted pain persistence over the next year, which was validated in a second cohort (n=22 SBP patients; SBPp=11 and SBPr=11), and showed no further alterations over a 1-year period. Tractography analysis indicated that abnormal regional FA was linked to differential structural connectivity to medial vs lateral prefrontal cortex. Local FA was correlated with functional connectivity between medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in SBPr. As we have earlier shown that the latter functional connectivity accurately predicts transition to chronic pain, we can conclude that brain structural differences, most likely existing before the back pain-inciting event and independent of the back pain, predispose subjects to pain chronification.},

Supplementation with NAD(+) precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), protects against metabolic disease, neurodegenerative disorders and age-related physiological decline in mammals. Here we show that nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 (NRK1) is necessary and rate-limiting for the use of exogenous NR and NMN for NAD(+) synthesis. Using genetic gain- and loss-of-function models, we further demonstrate that the role of NRK1 in driving NAD(+) synthesis from other NAD(+) precursors, such as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid, is dispensable. Using stable isotope-labelled compounds, we confirm NMN is metabolized extracellularly to NR that is then taken up by the cell and converted into NAD(+). Our results indicate that mammalian cells require conversion of extracellular NMN to NR for cellular uptake and NAD(+) synthesis, explaining the overlapping metabolic effects observed with the two compounds.},

abstract = {Turning attention towards or away from a painful heat stimulus is known to modify both the subjective intensity of pain and the cortical evoked potentials to noxious stimuli. Using PET, we investigated in 12 volunteers whether pain-related regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes were also modulated by attention. High (mean 46.6 degrees C) or low (mean 39 degrees C) intensity thermal stimuli were applied to the hand under three attentional conditions: (i) attention directed towards the stimuli, (ii) attention diverted from the stimuli, and (iii) no task. Only the insular/second somatosensory cortices were found to respond whatever the attentional context and might, therefore, subserve the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain (intensity coding). In parallel, other rCBF changes previously described as 'pain-related' appeared to depend essentially on the attentional context. Attention to the thermal stimulus involved a large network which was primarily right-sided, including prefrontal, posterior parietal, anterior cingulate cortices and thalamus. Anterior cingulate activity was not found to pertain to the intensity coding network but rather to the attentional neural activity triggered by pain. The attentional network disclosed in this study could be further subdivided into a non-specific arousal component, involving thalamic and upper brainstem regions, and a selective attention and orientating component including prefrontal, posterior parietal and cingulate cortices. A further effect observed in response to high intensity stimuli was a rCBF decrease within the somatosensory cortex ipsilateral to stimulation, which was considered to reflect contrast enhancing and/or anticipation processes. Attentional processes could possibly explain part of the variability observed in previous PET reports and should therefore be considered in further studies on pain in both normal subjects and patients with chronic pain.},

abstract = {Sensitization to continued nociceptive stimulation is supposed to be involved in the development of chronic pain at several levels of the CNS, but experimental studies investigating the perceptual dynamics of sensitization in humans are rare, and the diagnostic validity of experimental pain models is not known. The present study used a tonic heat paradigm to assess early sensitization (15-100 s) to experimental pain in 30 chronic pain patients (15 musculoskeletal/back pain, 15 headache) and 23 healthy controls. Change in pain sensation during prolonged stimulation was measured by a dual sensitization method which combines subjective ratings and behavioural responses in an indirect psychophysical protocol protected against response bias. Phasic and tonic pain thresholds were measured for control purposes. The degree of sensitization was linearly related to stimulus temperature, and groups differed significantly in this 'sensitization gradient': chronic pain patients sensitized earlier and stronger than healthy subjects, musculoskeletal pain patients showed the strongest effect. Pain thresholds were lowered in headache patients only. Discriminant analysis demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity of individual sensitization measures for distinguishing pain syndromes, particularly in combination with pain thresholds. The results are in accordance with current models of spinal plasticity contributing to pathological pain states. They argue for the diagnostic value of psychophysical measures of sensitization},

abstract = {In this review, we integrate recent human and animal studies from the viewpoint of chronic pain. First, we briefly review the impact of chronic pain on society and address current pitfalls of its definition and clinical management. Second, we examine pain mechanisms via nociceptive information transmission cephalad and its impact and interaction with the cortex. Third, we present recent discoveries on the active role of the cortex in chronic pain, with findings indicating that the human cortex continuously reorganizes as it lives in chronic pain. We also introduce data emphasizing that distinct chronic pain conditions impact on the cortex in unique patterns. Fourth, animal studies regarding nociceptive transmission, recent evidence for supraspinal reorganization during pain, the necessity of descending modulation for maintenance of neuropathic behavior, and the impact of cortical manipulations on neuropathic pain is also reviewed. We further expound on the notion that chronic pain can be reformulated within the context of learning and memory, and demonstrate the relevance of the idea in the design of novel pharmacotherapies. Lastly, we integrate the human and animal data into a unified working model outlining the mechanism by which acute pain transitions into a chronic state. It incorporates knowledge of underlying brain structures and their reorganization, and also includes specific variations as a function of pain persistence and injury type, thereby providing mechanistic descriptions of several unique chronic pain conditions within a single model.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify subgroups of patients with chronic pain based on the occurrence of depression, anxiety and catastrophising and the duration of pain and pain intensity. In addition to this, the relationship between the subgroups with respect to background variables, diagnosis, pain-related disability and perceived quality of life are investigated. METHODS: This study used 433 patients with chronic pain including 47 patients with spinal cord injury-related pain, 150 with chronic whiplash associated disorders and 236 with fibromyalgia. The participants answered a postal questionnaire that provided background data, pain intensity and duration and psychological and health-related items. RESULTS: On the basis of depression, anxiety, catastrophising, pain intensity and duration, we identified subgroups of patients with chronic pain that differed with respect to perceived quality of life, disability and diagnosis. The psychological factors, especially depression, significantly influenced perceived quality of life and disability. Pain intensity and duration play a minor role with respect to quality of life, although pain intensity is associated to perceived disability. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the importance of not looking at patients with chronic pain as a homogenous entity. A detailed assessment, including psychological factors with emphasis on depressive symptoms, might be essential for planning and carrying through treatment and rehabilitation},

@article{Farquharson2013,
abstract = {OBJECT: Diffusion-based MRI tractography is an imaging tool increasingly used in neurosurgical procedures to generate 3D maps of white matter pathways as an aid to identifying safe margins of resection. The majority of white matter fiber tractography software packages currently available to clinicians rely on a fundamentally flawed framework to generate fiber orientations from diffusion-weighted data, namely diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This work provides the first extensive and systematic exploration of the practical limitations of DTI-based tractography and investigates whether the higher-order tractography model constrained spherical deconvolution provides a reasonable solution to these problems within a clinically feasible timeframe.

METHODS: Comparison of tractography methodologies in visualizing the corticospinal tracts was made using the diffusion-weighted data sets from 45 healthy controls and 10 patients undergoing presurgical imaging assessment. Tensor-based and constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography methodologies were applied to both patients and controls.

RESULTS: Diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography methods (using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography algorithms) substantially underestimated the extent of tracks connecting to the sensorimotor cortex in all participants in the control group. In contrast, the constrained spherical deconvolution tractography method consistently produced the biologically expected fan-shaped configuration of tracks. In the clinical cases, in which tractography was performed to visualize the corticospinal pathways in patients with concomitant risk of neurological deficit following neurosurgical resection, the constrained spherical deconvolution-based and tensor-based tractography methodologies indicated very different apparent safe margins of resection; the constrained spherical deconvolution-based method identified corticospinal tracts extending to the entire sensorimotor cortex, while the tensor-based method only identified a narrow subset of tracts extending medially to the vertex.

CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive study shows that the most widely used clinical tractography method (diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography) results in systematically unreliable and clinically misleading information. The higher-order tractography model, using the same diffusion-weighted data, clearly demonstrates fiber tracts more accurately, providing improved estimates of safety margins that may be useful in neurosurgical procedures. We therefore need to move beyond the diffusion tensor framework if we are to begin to provide neurosurgeons with biologically reliable tractography information.},

abstract = {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder and is often refractory to medical treatment. Surgical therapies, using lesioning and deep brain stimulation in the thalamus, have been used to treat essential tremor that is disabling and resistant to medication. Although often effective, these treatments have risks associated with an open neurosurgical procedure. MR-guided focused ultrasound has been developed as a non-invasive means of generating precisely placed focal lesions. We examined its application to the management of essential tremor. METHODS: Our study was done in Toronto, Canada, between May, 2012, and January, 2013. Four patients with chronic and medication-resistant essential tremor were treated with MR-guided focused ultrasound to ablate tremor-mediating areas of the thalamus. Patients underwent tremor evaluation and neuroimaging at baseline and 1 month and 3 months after surgery. Outcome measures included tremor severity in the treated arm, as measured by the clinical rating scale for tremor, and treatment-related adverse events. FINDINGS: Patients showed immediate and sustained improvements in tremor in the dominant hand. Mean reduction in tremor score of the treated hand was 89{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} at 1 month and 81{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} at 3 months. This reduction was accompanied by functional benefits and improvements in writing and motor tasks. One patient had postoperative paraesthesias which persisted at 3 months. Another patient developed a deep vein thrombosis, potentially related to the length of the procedure. INTERPRETATION: MR-guided focused ultrasound might be a safe and effective approach to generation of focal intracranial lesions for the management of disabling, medication-resistant essential tremor. If larger trials validate the safety and ascertain the efficacy and durability of this new approach, it might change the way that patients with essential tremor and potentially other disorders are treated.

abstract = {The decision as to whether a sensation is perceived as painful does not only depend on sensory input but also on the significance of the stimulus. Here, we show that the degree to which an impending stimulus is interpreted as threatening biases perceptual decisions about pain and that this bias toward pain manifests before stimulus encounter. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the influence of an experimental manipulation of threat on the perception of laser stimuli as painful. In a near-threshold pain detection paradigm, physically identical stimuli were applied under the participants' assumption that the stimulation is entirely safe (low threat) or potentially harmful (high threat). As hypothesized, significantly more stimuli were rated as painful in the high threat condition. This context-dependent classification of a stimulus as painful was predicted by the prestimulus signal level in the anterior insula, suggesting that this structure integrates information about the significance of a stimulus into the decision about pain. The anticipation of pain increased the prestimulus functional connectivity between the anterior insula and the midcingulate cortex (MCC), a region that was significantly more active during stimulation the more a participant was biased to rate the stimulation as painful under high threat. These findings provide evidence that the anterior insula and MCC as a "salience network" integrate information about the significance of an impending stimulation into perceptual decision-making in the context of pain.},

White matter pathway asymmetry was investigated in a normalized image data set of 30 right-handed young healthy individuals. We identified, for the first time, a rightwardly asymmetric pathway connecting the posterior temporal lobe to the superior parietal lobule. This pathway may be related to auditory spatial attention and working memory for which there is evidence for a rightward laterality from functional imaging studies. Additional leftward asymmetries connecting the parietal and frontal lobes to the temporal lobe may be more closely related to laterality of language},

Manifestations include lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, and mononeuropathy multiplex. Encephalopathy, identical to that seen in many systemic inflammatory diseases, can occur during active systemic infection. It is not specific to Lyme disease and only rarely is evidence of nervous system infection. Diagnosis of systemic disease is based on demonstration of specific antibodies in peripheral blood by means of two-tier testing with an ELISA and Western blot. Central nervous system infection often results in specific antibody production in the CSF, demonstrable by comparing spinal fluid to blood serologies. Treatment is straightforward and curative in most instances. Many patients can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics such as doxycycline; in severe CNS infection parenteral treatment with ceftriaxone or other similar agents is highly effective. Treatment should usually be for 2 to at most 4 weeks. Longer treatment adds no therapeutic benefit but does add substantial risk. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The probabilistic streamlines [1] approach is one of the most promising methods to perform diffusion-weighted tractography. It takes into consideration the inherent noisy nature of DW data, extends naturally to allow fibre tracking through regions containing crossing fibres, and can be implemented to be relatively fast. However, current implementations of this algorithm work by stepping along an orientation derived from the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) at the current point only, and can hence be viewed as first order integration methods. Such methods are known to ‘overshoot', and this effect has indeed previously been reported for the deterministic streamlines algorithm [2]. Higher order (Runge-Kutta) integration methods have been proposed to improve the quality of tracking results obtained using tensor-based deterministic streamlines [3], but unfortunately these are not suitable for probabilistic multi-fibre fibre- tracking applications. In this study, we propose a novel higher order probabilistic streamlines method, based on 2nd order integration over fibre orientation distributions (iFOD2).},

A better understanding of these aspects would be of considerable benefit in helping to define whether similar psychological treatment strategies (eg, cognitive-behavioural therapy) can be adopted in the management of neuropathic pain as in non-neuropathic pain conditions. Chronic orofacial pain disorders present a unique opportunity to compare nociceptive and neuropathic pain in the same body region. Twenty-four patients with trigeminal neuropathic pain, 21 patients with temporomandibular disorder, and 38 healthy controls were assessed with a psychological/psychosocial battery encompassing the 4 dimensions of the pain experience; sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational, cognitive-evaluative, and psychosocial. Although patients with trigeminal neuropathic pain (neuropathic pain) and temporomandibular disorder (non-neuropathic pain) described the sensory aspects of their pain differently, they exhibited comparable negative affective-motivational, cognitive-evaluative, and psychosocial states, although these were significantly different compared to healthy controls. These findings support growing evidence that the negative affective, cognitive, and psychosocial state of chronic pain is universal, regardless of a neuropathic or nociceptive nature. Further characterisation of these 4 dimensions of the pain experience in different chronic pain subtypes may improve the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy},

abstract = {Pain often exists in the absence of observable injury; therefore, the gold standard for pain assessment has long been self-report. Because the inability to verbally communicate can prevent effective pain management, research efforts have focused on the development of a tool that accurately assesses pain without depending on self-report. Those previous efforts have not proven successful at substituting self-report with a clinically valid, physiology-based measure of pain. Recent neuroimaging data suggest that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and support vector machine (SVM) learning can be jointly used to accurately assess cognitive states. Therefore, we hypothesized that an SVM trained on fMRI data can assess pain in the absence of self-report. In fMRI experiments, 24 individuals were presented painful and nonpainful thermal stimuli. Using eight individuals, we trained a linear SVM to distinguish these stimuli using whole-brain patterns of activity. We assessed the performance of this trained SVM model by testing it on 16 individuals whose data were not used for training. The whole-brain SVM was 81{\%} accurate at distinguishing painful from non-painful stimuli (p{\textless}0.0000001). Using distance from the SVM hyperplane as a confidence measure, accuracy was further increased to 84{\%}, albeit at the expense of excluding 15{\%} of the stimuli that were the most difficult to classify. Overall performance of the SVM was primarily affected by activity in pain-processing regions of the brain including the primary somatosensory cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, insular cortex, primary motor cortex, and cingulate cortex. Region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed that whole-brain patterns of activity led to more accurate classification than localized activity from individual brain regions. Our findings demonstrate that fMRI with SVM learning can assess pain without requiring any communication from the person being tested. We outline tasks that should be completed to advance this approach toward use in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Whole-brain anatomical connectivity in living humans can be modeled as a network with diffusion-MRI and tractography. Network nodes are associated with distinct grey-matter regions, while white-matter fiber bundles serve as interconnecting network links. However, the lack of a gold standard for regional parcellation in brain MRI makes the definition of nodes arbitrary, meaning that network nodes are defined using templates employing either random or anatomical parcellation criteria. Consequently, the number of nodes included in networks studied by different authors has varied considerably, from less than 100 up to more than 10(4). Here, we systematically and quantitatively assess the behavior, structure and topological attributes of whole-brain anatomical networks over a wide range of nodal scales, a variety of grey-matter parcellations as well as different diffusion-MRI acquisition protocols. We show that simple binary decisions about network organization, such as whether small-worldness or scale-freeness is evident, are unaffected by spatial scale, and that the estimates of various organizational parameters (e.g. small-worldness, clustering, path length, and efficiency) are consistent across different parcellation scales at the same resolution (i.e. the same number of nodes). However, these parameters vary considerably as a function of spatial scale; for example small-worldness exhibited a difference of 95{\%} between the widely-used automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template (approximately 100 nodes) and a 4000-node random parcellation (sigma(AAL)=1.9 vs. sigma(4000)=53.6+/-2.2). These findings indicate that any comparison of network parameters across studies must be made with reference to the spatial scale of the nodal parcellation.},

abstract = {Neuropathic pain is triggered by lesions to the somatosensory nervous system that alter its structure and function so that pain occurs spontaneously and responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli are pathologically amplified. The pain is an expression of maladaptive plasticity within the nociceptive system, a series of changes that constitute a neural disease state. Multiple alterations distributed widely across the nervous system contribute to complex pain phenotypes. These alterations include ectopic generation of action potentials, facilitation and disinhibition of synaptic transmission, loss of synaptic connectivity and formation of new synaptic circuits, and neuroimmune interactions. Although neural lesions are necessary, they are not sufficient to generate neuropathic pain; genetic polymorphisms, gender, and age all influence the risk of developing persistent pain. Treatment needs to move from merely suppressing symptoms to a disease-modifying strategy aimed at both preventing maladaptive plasticity and reducing intrinsic risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intraoperative displacement of major white matter tracts during glioma resection by comparing preoperative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking. METHODS: In 37 patients undergoing glioma surgery, preoperative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging was performed with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner applying an echo-planar imaging sequence with six diffusion directions. For three-dimensional tractography, we implemented a knowledge-based multiple-region-of-interest approach applying user-defined seed regions in the color-coded maps of fractional anisotropy. Tracking was initiated in both the retrograde and orthograde directions according to the direction of the principal eigenvector in each voxel of the region of interest. The tractography results were also assigned color, applying the convention used in color-coded fractional anisotropy maps. RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative fiber tracking was technically feasible in all patients. Fiber tract visualization gave a quick and intuitive overview of the displaced course of white matter tracts in three-dimensional space. Comparison of preoperative and intraoperative tractography depicted a marked shifting of major white matter tracts during glioma removal. Maximum white matter tract shifting ranged from -8 to +15 mm (+2.7 +/- 6.0 mm; mean +/- standard deviation); in 29.7{\%}, an inward and in 62.2{\%}, an outward shifting was detected. CONCLUSION: Comparing preoperative and intraoperative fiber tracking visualizes a marked shifting and deformation of major white matter tracts because of tumor removal. This shifting emphasizes the need for an intraoperative update of navigation systems during resection of deep-seated tumor portions near eloquent brain areas. Fiber tracking is a method not only for preoperative neurosurgical visualization but also for further intraoperative planning},

Compared to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), Q-ball imaging (QBI) allows for the depiction of multiple fiber directions within a voxel. However, this advantage has not yet been shown to translate directly to superior quantification of fiber integrity. Furthermore, recent developments in QBI reconstruction with solid angle consideration have led to sharper and intrinsically normalized orientation distribution functions. The implications of this technique on quantification are also unknown. To investigate this, the generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) from the original and the more recent QBI reconstruction scheme and the DTI derived fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated comparatively using Monte Carlo simulations and real MRI measurements of crossing fiber phantoms. Contrast-to-noise ratio, accuracy, independence of the acquisition setup and the relation of single fiber anisotropies to measured anisotropy in crossings were assessed. In homogeneous single-fiber regions at b-values around 1000 s/mm2, the FA performed best. While the original QBI reconstruction does not show a clear advantage even at higher b-values and in crossing regions, the new reconstruction scheme yields superior properties and is recommended for quantification at higher b-values and especially in regions of heterogeneous fiber configuration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: At 7T MR imaging, T2*-weighted gradient echo has been shown to provide high-resolution anatomic images of gray matter lesions. However, few studies have verified T2*WI lesions histopathologically or compared them with more standard techniques at ultra-high-field strength. This study aimed to determine the sensitivity of T2WI and T2*WI sequences for detecting cortical GM lesions in MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At 7T, 2D multiecho spin-echo T2WI and 3D gradient-echo T2*WI were acquired from 27 formalin-fixed coronal hemispheric brain sections of 15 patients and 4 healthy controls. Proteolipid-stained tissue sections (8 $\mu$m) were matched to the corresponding MR images, and lesions were manually scored on both MR imaging sequences (blinded to histopathology) and tissue sections (blinded to MR imaging). The sensitivity of MR imaging sequences for GM lesion types and white matter lesions was calculated. An unblinded retrospective scoring was also performed. RESULTS: If all cortical GM lesions were taken into account, the T2WI sequence detected slightly more lesions than the T2*WI sequence: 28{\%} and 16{\%}, respectively (P = .054). This difference disappeared when only intracortical lesions were considered. When histopathologic information (type, location) was revealed to the reader, the sensitivity went up to 84{\%} (T2WI) and 85{\%} (T2*WI) (not significant). Furthermore, the false-positive rate was 8.6{\%} for the T2WI and 10.5{\%} for the T2*WI sequence. CONCLUSIONS: There is no strong advantage of the T2*WI sequence compared with a conventional T2WI sequence in the detection of cortical lesions at 7T. Retrospectively, a high percentage of lesions could be detected with both sequences. However, many lesions are still missed prospectively. This could possibly be minimized with better a priori observer training.},

abstract = {The current study investigated the effects of psychological well-being measured as quality of life (QoL), depression, current mood and motivation on brain-computer interface (BCI) performance in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Six participants with most advanced ALS were trained either for a block of 20 sessions with a BCI based on sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) or a block of 10 sessions with a BCI based on event-related potentials, or both. Questionnaires assessed QoL and severity of depressive symptoms before each training block and mood and motivation before each training session. The SMR-BCI required more training than the P300-BCI. The information transfer rate was higher with the P300-BCI (3.25 bits/min) than with the SMR-BCI (1.16 bits/min). Mood and motivation were related to the number of BCI sessions. Motivational factors, specifically challenge and mastery confidence, were positively related to BCI performance (controlled for the number of sessions) in tow participants, while incompetence fear was negatively related with performance in one participant. BCI performance was not related to motivational factors in three other participants nor to mood in any of the six participants. We conclude that motivational factors may be related to BCI performance in individual subjects and suggest that motivational factors and well-being should be assessed in standard BCI protocols. We also recommend using P300-based BCI as first choice in severely paralyzed patients who present with a P300 evoked potential.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) infers the trajectory and location of large white matter tracts by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water. DTI data may then be analyzed and presented as tractography for visualization of the tracts in 3 dimensions. Despite the important information contained in tractography images, usefulness for neurosurgical planning has been limited by the inability to define which are critical structures within the mass of demonstrated fibers and to clarify their relationship to the tumor.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to allow the interactive querying of tractography data sets for surgical planning and to provide a working software package for the research community.

METHODS: The tool was implemented within an open source software project. Echo-planar DTI at 3 T was performed on 5 patients, followed by tensor calculation. Software was developed that allowed the placement of a dynamic seed point for local selection of fibers and for fiber display around a segmented structure, both with tunable parameters. A neurosurgeon was trained in the use of software in {\textless} 1 hour and used it to review cases.

RESULTS: Tracts near tumor and critical structures were interactively visualized in 3 dimensions to determine spatial relationships to lesion. Tracts were selected using 3 methods: anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging-defined regions of interest, distance from the segmented tumor volume, and dynamic seed-point spheres.

CONCLUSION: Interactive tractography successfully enabled inspection of white matter structures that were in proximity to lesions, critical structures, and functional cortical areas, allowing the surgeon to explore the relationships between them.},

We therefore introduce a concrete definition of cognitive training (CT) and make this the focus of our article. Clinical research that has evaluated CT in normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia is then critically reviewed. Despite many methodological shortcomings, the overall findings indicate that multidomain CT has the potential to improve cognitive function in healthy older adults and slow decline in affected individuals.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In a previous study using streamlined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) axonal tracking at 1.5 T, we found that the main afferents to the human red nucleus arise from the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices. However, the spatial resolution of our data was low and our streamlining DTI algorithm was less powerful than the probabilistic tractography algorithm usually used to define connections between low anisotropic cortical or nuclear areas. Therefore, we reassessed and completed our previous results with trajectories computed with a probabilistic algorithm and with a high-field MRI system. METHODS: Afferents to the red nuclei of five volunteers were studied at 3 T using probabilistic DTI axonal tracking. RESULTS: Trajectories were constantly tracked between the red nucleus and the ipsilateral prefrontal, pericentral, temporal and occipital cortices, and the ipsilateral lentiform and contralateral dentate nuclei. We showed that the dentate nucleus was connected to the mammillary tubercle and, through the contralateral ventral thalamus, to the frontal and prefrontal cortices. CONCLUSION: The red nucleus receives extensive projections from the cerebral cortex and has dense subcortical connections to the striopallidal system.},

abstract = {Skin inflammation causes innocuous heat to become painful. This condition, called heat allodynia, is a common feature of pathological pain states. Here, we show that heat allodynia is functionally and neuroanatomically distinct from normal heat pain. We subtracted positron emission tomography scans obtained during painful heating of normal skin from scans during equally intense but normally innocuous heating of capsaicin-treated skin. This comparison reveals the specific activation of a medial thalamic pathway to the frontal lobe during heat allodynia. The results suggest that different central pathways mediate the intensity and certain qualitative aspects of pain. In making this differentiation, the brain recognizes unique physiological features of different painful conditions, thus permitting adaptive responses to different pain states.},

abstract = {Axonal injury occurs even in the earliest stages of multiple sclerosis. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) measurements of brain N:-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of axonal integrity, show that this axonal injury can occur even in the absence of clinically evident functional impairments. To test whether cortical adaptive responses contribute to the maintenance of normal motor function in patients with multiple sclerosis, we performed MRSI and functional MRI (fMRI) examinations of nine multiple sclerosis patients who had unimpaired hand function. We found that activation of the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex with simple hand movements was increased by a mean of fivefold relative to normal controls (n = 8) and that the extent of this increase was strongly correlated (sigma = -0.93, P = 0.001) with decreases in brain NAA. These results suggest that compensatory cortical adaptive responses may help to account for the limited relationship between conventional MRI measures of lesion burden and clinical measures of disability, and that therapies directed towards promoting cortical reorganization in response to brain injury could enhance recovery from relapses of multiple sclerosis.},

abstract = {Lumbosacral radicular pain is characterized by a radiating pain in one or more lumbar or sacral dermatomes; it may or may not be accompanied by other radicular irritation symptoms and/or symptoms of decreased function. The annual prevalence in the general population, described as low back pain with leg pain traveling below the knee, varied from 9.9{\%} to 25{\%}, which means that it is presumably the most commonly occurring form of neuropathic pain. The patient's history may give a suggestion of lumbosacral radicular pain. The best known clinical investigation is the straight-leg raising test. Final diagnosis is made based on a combination of clinical examination and potentially additional tests. Medical imaging studies are indicated to exclude possible serious pathologies and to confirm the affected level in patients suffering lumbosacral radicular pain for longer than 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred. Selective diagnostic blocks help confirming the affected level. There is controversy concerning the effectiveness of conservative management (physical therapy, exercise) and pharmacological treatment. When conservative treatment fails, in subacute lumbosacral radicular pain under the level L3 as the result of a contained herniation, transforaminal corticosteroid administration is recommended (2 B+). In chronic lumbosacral radicular pain, (pulsed) radiofrequency treatment adjacent to the spinal ganglion (DRG) can be considered (2 C+). For refractory lumbosacral radicular pain, adhesiolysis and epiduroscopy can be considered (2 B+/-), preferentially study-related. In patients with a therapy-resistant radicular pain in the context of a Failed Back Surgery Syndrome, spinal cord stimulation is recommended (2 A+). This treatment should be performed in specialized centers},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging and related fibre tracking techniques have the potential to identify major white matter tracts afflicted by an individual pathology or tracts at risk for a given surgical approach. However, the reliability of these techniques is known to be limited by image distortions, image noise, low spatial resolution, and the problem of identifying crossing fibres. This paper intends to bridge the gap between the requirements of neurosurgical applications and basic research on fibre tracking uncertainty. METHOD: We acquired echo planar diffusion tensor data from both 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners. For fibre tracking, an extended deflection-based algorithm is employed with enhanced robustness to impaired fibre integrity such as caused by diffuse or infiltrating pathological processes. Moreover, we present a method to assess and visualize the uncertainty of fibre reconstructions based on variational complex Gaussian noise, which provides an alternative to the bootstrap method. We compare fibre tracking results with and without variational noise as well as with artificially decreased image resolution and signal-to-noise. FINDINGS: Using our fibre tracking technique, we found a high robustness to decreased image resolution and signal-to-noise. Still, the effects of image quality on the tracking result will depend on the employed fibre tracking algorithm and must be handled with care, especially when being used for neurosurgical planning or resection guidance. An advantage of the variational noise approach over the bootstrap technique is that it is applicable to any given set of diffusion tensor images. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the presented approach allows for investigating the uncertainty of diffusion tensor imaging based fibre tracking and might offer a perspective to overcome the problem of size underestimation observed by existing techniques},

abstract = {The neuromatrix theory of pain proposes that pain is a multidimensional experience produced by characteristic "neurosignature" patterns of nerve impulses generated by a widely distributed neural network--the "body-self neuromatrix"--in the brain. These neurosignature patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but they may also be generated independently of them. Pains that are evoked by noxious sensory inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernible injury or pathology, remain a mystery. The neuromatrix theory of pain, however, provides a new conceptual framework that is consistent with recent clinical evidence. It proposes that the output patterns of the neuromatrix activate perceptual, homeostatic and behavioral programs after injury or pathology, or as a result of multiple other inputs that act on the neuromatrix. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation or other pathology. The neuromatrix, which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the neuromatrix.},

Recent findings from animal and neuroimaging studies suggest that phantom limb pain might be a central phenomenon, related to changes in the cortical, thalamic and spinal representation of the painful limb, and might be a type of somatosensory pain memory. Based on these assumptions, new treatment approaches focus on sensory discrimination training or motor cortex stimulation in an effort to influence cortical reorganization. Prevention of perpetuation of a somatosensory pain memory might also be possible through pharmacological agents such as N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists and gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists, substances that have been shown to influence and prevent cortical reorganization},

abstract = {Despite the common belief that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a painless disease, several studies contradict this. There are a significant number of MS patients who actually suffer from painful conditions such as central and peripheral neuropathy, migraines, trigeminal neuralgia, painful tonic spasms, complex regional pain syndrome, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and transverse myelitis. In addition, MS relapses are usually painful with many patients complaining of paroxysmal dystonia and neuropathic pain during these episodes. Additionally, treatments for MS such as use of beta-interferons may be associated with headache and pain at the injection site. The pathophysiology of pain in MS is poorly understood, but may be related to the development of demyelinating lesions involving certain neuroanatomic pathways such as the spinothalamic tract. Management of pain in MS patients is a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Currently, various pharmacological agents such as antiepielptics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and even corticosteroids are used to suppress various painful conditions associated with MS. Non-pharmacological procedures such as massage therapy have also been used in the treatment of MS patients. The authors present a review of recent findings in pathophysiology and management of pain in MS patients.},

abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

abstract = {Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic facial pain classified as a neuropathic pain. There is widespread agreement regarding the International Association for the Study of Pain definition of classical idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia as "a sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve." However, there are variations in presentation that are less easy to diagnose and an erroneous diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is occasionally made. In patients with tumors or multiple sclerosis, trigeminal neuralgia is termed secondary. Currently, clinical manifestations are the mainstay for diagnosis because there are no objective tests to validate the diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of these clinical manifestations is reviewed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional fast-in-flow with steady-state precession MRI are performed to determine the presence of tumors or plaques of multiple sclerosis and to assess possible compressions and deformations of the trigeminal nerve. Their specificity and sensitivity regarding compressions found at the time of surgery is reviewed. Other differential diagnoses for chronic unilateral orofacial pain are discussed},

abstract = {In response to recent publications from pain neuroimaging experiments, there has been a debate about the existence of a primary pain region in the brain. Yet, there are few meta-analyses providing assessments of the minimum cerebral denominators of pain. Here, we used a statistical meta-analysis method, called Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE), to define 1) core brain regions activated by pain per se, irrelevant of pain modality, paradigm, or participants, and 2) ALE commonalities and differences between patients with chronic pain and healthy individuals. A subtraction analysis of 138 independent datasets revealed that the minimum denominator for activation across pain modalities and paradigms included the right insula, secondary sensory cortex, and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Common activations for healthy subjects and pain patients alike included the thalamus, ACC, insula, and cerebellum. A comparative analysis revealed that healthy individuals were more likely to activate the cingulum, thalamus and insula. Our results point towards the central role of the insular cortex and ACC in pain processing, irrelevant of modality, body part, or clinical experience, thus furthering the importance of ACC and insular activation as key regions for the human experience of pain.},

abstract = {Pain is ubiquitous. At some point in time it affects everyone. For many millions pain becomes chronic, a scourge that impacts every facet of life-work, hobbies, family relations, social fabric, finances, happiness, mood, and even the very essence of identity. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), pain is one of our most important national public health problems, a silent epidemic. In 1998, NIH reported that the annual amount spent on health care, compensation, and litigation related to pain had reached one hundred billion dollars ({\$}100,000,000,000). Considering that health care costs have doubled since then, it is not unreasonable to assume that the costs related to pain care have doubled as well. Millions of patients suffer needlessly with acute pain, with cancer pain, and with chronic pain. The ineffective management of pain results in an escalating cascade of health care issues. Acute pain that is not treated adequately and promptly results in persistent pain that eventually causes irreversible changes in the nervous system. This translates into progressive bio-psycho-social epiphenomena resulting in further pain and disability. It creates a vicious cycle transforming a functional human being into an invalid who becomes a burden to family, to society, and to oneself. In the face of adequate medical science, adequate technical skills, and adequate resources the reality of delayed and inadequate pain care is paradoxical. This dilemma deserves close scrutiny and effective remediation. The American Medical Association (AMA), long dedicated to the need to improve pain care in this country, has been faced with this reality. It was from this vision that the idea of holding a Pain Medicine Summit was conceived. Resolution 321 (A-08) set in motion a process that would bring together a diverse group of stakeholders for the purpose of discussing the present and future status of pain care; a process that culminated in a broad-based coalition of physicians and organizations dedicated to improving pain care, the first National Pain Medicine Summit. The process began with the adoption of Resolution 321 (A-08) at an AMA Annual House of Delegates meeting in June 2008. Resolution 321 (A-08) states, in part, that "...the AMA encourages relevant specialties to collaborate in studying: 1) the scope and practice and body of knowledge encompassed by the field of Pain Medicine; 2) the adequacy of undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate education in the principles and practices of the field of Pain Medicine, considering the current and anticipated medical need for the delivery of quality pain care; and 3) appropriate training and credentialing criteria for this multi-disciplinary field of medical practice." The next step was delegating the responsibility for implementing Resolution 321 (A-08) to the Pain and Palliative Medicine Specialty Section Council (PPMSSC). The PPMSSC, under the direction of its chairman, Philipp M. Lippe, MD, FACS, assumed responsibility in November 2008 for identifying a process that would achieve the goals established by Resolution 321 (A-08). The PPMSSC in turn established an Advisory Committee, charged with strategic planning, and an Implementation Committee, charged with tactical operations. The two groups began work immediately. The process included three distinct phases centered on a Pain Medicine Summit. Phase One involved a modified Delphi process identifying the five most pressing and relevant themes in pain care. Phase Two consisted of the Pain Medicine Summit itself, including a gathering of representatives from across the pain care spectrum to address the previously identified five most pressing themes. Phase Three was the preparation of this report, which describes the conclusions drawn and recommendations developed by the attendees at the Pain Medicine Summit. Based on a recommendation from the Advisory Committee, the PPMSSC decided to retain the services of a consulting firm to help the PPMSSC implement the Pain Medicine Summit process. In August 2009, PPMSSC selected Grey Matters, a New York-based advisory firm. The PPMSSC also appointed a Steering Committee to assist Grey Matters and to coordinate all activities. The Committee consisted of Charles Brock, MD; Ronald Crossno, MD; Jose David, MD; Michel Dubois, MD; Albert Ray, MD; and Philipp M. Lippe, MD, FACS (chair). The consulting firm, Grey Matters, proposed a multi-phasic process in order to facilitate the implementation of the Pain Medicine Summit and to ensure a coordinated, efficient, and productive outcome. This process consisting of three phases-pre-summit, summit, and post-summit-is described in detail in the following section. All aspects of the project were closely coordinated and supervised by the Steering Committee, which included the selection of the team leaders of the five Workgroups, based on specific criteria. The Pain Medicine Summit, adhering to the dictates of Resolution 321 (A-08), explored the body of knowledge and the scope of practice of Pain Medicine; the education and training in medical school, graduate, and postgraduate programs; and the credentialing and certification processes in the field of Pain Medicine. It addressed the barriers hampering delivery of high quality pain care. It recognized the need for clarification and consensus in many areas. Several points of consensus emerged: The continuum of medical education in the field of Pain Medicine is inadequate and fragmented. It needs to be fortified in scope, content, and duration. Credentialing and certification processes in Pain Medicine are variable, diverse, and deficient in many instances. Deficiencies in these areas lead to suboptimal and fragmented pain care having a negative impact on direct patient care and public health. Effective and prompt remediation is desirable and essential to achieving the goal of high quality pain care. Barriers exist inhibiting or retarding progress toward the common good. There are several viable avenues to achieving our stated goal, "excellence in the delivery of high quality, cost-effective pain care to the patients we serve," including the development of Pain Medicine as a distinct specialty with ACGME accredited residency programs and ABMS certification. The Pain Medicine Summit concluded with a number of recommendations, including the following: That the pain community remains engaged in addressing the issues raised and in mitigating the barriers. That the recommendations be referred to the AMA and the PPMSSC for support and implementation. That another national Pain Medicine Summit with enhanced participation be convened. That consideration be given to convening an International Pain Summit in conjunction with the IASP World Congress in Montreal. That the final report of the Pain Medicine Summit be widely disseminated},

abstract = {Ever since the introduction of the concept of fiber tractography, methods to generate better and more plausible tractograms have become available. Many modern methods can handle complex fiber architecture and take on a probabilistic approach to account for different sources of uncertainty. The resulting tractogram from any such method typically represents a finite random sample from a complex distribution of possible tracks. Generating a higher amount of tracks allows for a more accurate depiction of the underlying distribution. The recently proposed method of track-density imaging (TDI) allows to capture the spatial distribution of a tractogram. In this work, we propose an extension of TDI towards the 5D spatio-angular domain, which we name track orientation density imaging (TODI). The proposed method aims to capture the full track orientation distribution (TOD). Just as the TDI map, the TOD is amenable to spatial super-resolution (or even sub-resolution), but in addition also to angular super-resolution. Through experiments on in vivo human subject data, an in silico numerical phantom and a challenging tractography phantom, we found that the TOD presents an increased amount of regional spatio-angular consistency, as compared to the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) from constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD). Furthermore, we explain how the amplitude of the TOD of a short-tracks distribution (i.e. where the track length is limited) can be interpreted as a measure of track-like local support (TLS). This in turn motivated us to explore the idea of TOD-based fiber tractography. In such a setting, the short-tracks TOD is able to guide a track along directions that are more likely to correspond to continuous structure over a longer distance. This powerful concept is shown to greatly robustify targeted as well as whole-brain tractography. We conclude that the TOD is a versatile tool that can be cast in many different roles and scenarios in the expanding domain of fiber tractography based methods and their applications.},

abstract = {Structural imaging is turning our attention regarding the effects of chronic pain on the brain as a possible source of chronicity. Several independent studies have suggested a decrease in gray matter in pain-transmitting areas in patients with constant pain. Most of these data are discussed as representing damage or loss of brain gray matter, reinforcing the idea of chronic pain as a progressive disease. However, any data of an increase or decrease in gray matter in pain syndromes need to be considered in light of all observations gathered in the past 10 years and probably do not justify a discussion of brain damage or consideration of whether the disease is progressive. It is likely that these changes are the consequence and not the cause of the respective pain syndromes as they may reverse once the pain is adequately treated. Moreover, structural changes of the brain may not be specific to a particular pain syndrome and for the moment only mirror the magnitude or duration of pain suffered. The topographical distributions of gray matter changes may well be the consequence of cortical regions having varying susceptibilities. We need to better understand the behavioral consequences and cellular mechanisms underlying these neuroanatomic changes},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state temporal correlations (RSTC) are two leading techniques for investigating the connectivity of the human brain. They have been widely used to investigate the strength of anatomical and functional connections between distant brain regions in healthy subjects, and in clinical populations. Though they are both based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) they have not yet been compared directly. In this work both techniques were employed to create global connectivity matrices covering the whole brain gray matter. This allowed for direct comparisons between functional connectivity measured by RSTC with anatomical connectivity quantified using DTI tractography. We found that connectivity matrices obtained using both techniques showed significant agreement. Connectivity maps created for a priori defined anatomical regions showed significant correlation, and furthermore agreement was especially high in regions showing strong overall connectivity, such as those belonging to the default mode network. Direct comparison between functional RSTC and anatomical DTI connectivity, presented here for the first time, links two powerful approaches for investigating brain connectivity and shows their strong agreement. It provides a crucial multi-modal validation for resting state correlations as representing neuronal connectivity. The combination of both techniques presented here allows for further combining them to provide richer representation of brain connectivity both in the healthy brain and in clinical conditions},

abstract = {To understand the effects of a cortical lesion it is necessary to consider not only the loss of local neural function, but also the lesion-induced changes in the larger network of endogenous oscillatory interactions in the brain. To investigate how network embedding influences a region's functional role, and the consequences of its being damaged, we implement two models of oscillatory cortical interactions, both of which inherit their coupling architecture from the available anatomical connection data for macaque cerebral cortex. In the first model, node dynamics are governed by Kuramoto phase oscillator equations, and we investigate the sequence in which areas entrain one another in the transition to global synchrony. In the second model, node dynamics are governed by a more realistic neural mass model, and we assess long-run inter-regional interactions using a measure of directed information flow. Highly connected parietal and frontal areas are found to synchronize most rapidly, more so than equally highly connected visual and somatosensory areas, and this difference can be explained in terms of the network's clustered architecture. For both models, lesion effects extend beyond the immediate neighbors of the lesioned site, and the amplitude and dispersal of nonlocal effects are again influenced by cluster patterns in the network. Although the consequences of in vivo lesions will always depend on circuitry local to the damaged site, we conclude that lesions of parietal regions (especially areas 5 and 7a) and frontal regions (especially areas 46 and FEF) have the greatest potential to disrupt the integrative aspects of neocortical function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Trigeminal neuralgia secondary to multiple sclerosis (MS-TN) is a facial neuropathic pain syndrome similar to classic trigeminal neuralgia (TN). While TN is caused by neurovascular compression of the fifth cranial nerve (CN V), how MS-related demyelination correlates with pain in MS-TN is not understood. OBJECTIVES We aim to examine diffusivities along CN V in MS-TN, TN, and controls in order to reveal differential neuroimaging correlates across groups. METHODS 3T MR diffusion weighted, T1, T2 and FLAIR sequences were acquired for MS-TN, TN, and controls. Multi-tensor tractography was used to delineate CN V across cisternal, root entry zone (REZ), pontine and peri-lesional segments. Diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial (RD), axial (AD), and mean diffusivities (MD) were measured from each segment. RESULTS CN V segments showed distinctive diffusivity patterns. The TN group showed higher FA in the cisternal segment ipsilateral to the side of pain, and lower FA in the ipsilateral REZ segment. The MS-TN group showed lower FA in the ipsilateral peri-lesional segments, suggesting differential microstructural changes along CN V in these conditions. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrates objective differences in CN V microstrucuture in TN and MS-TN using non-invasive neuroimaging. This represents a significant improvement in the methods currently available to study pain in MS.},

Trigeminal neuropathic pain could be defined as constant unilateral facial pain of variable intensity, is non-triggerable, and unremitting. Atypical trigeminal neuralgia is an overlap syndrome with both episodic and constant pain. Patients with clear pathology of the trigeminal system often have sensory loss and atypical pains. The leading theory of causation of typical trigeminal neuralgia points to minimal compression and demyelination at the root entry zone (REZ) of the trigeminal nerve. In the experience of many neurosurgeons, atypical pains result from lesions or injuries of the trigeminal nerve root distal to the REZ. In a review of 122 patients, distal trigeminal pathology correlated with a clinical syndrome of trigeminal neuropathic pain. An hypothesis is presented that peripheral lesions of the trigeminal nerve behave as do other peripheral nerve lesions in that they are associated with sensory loss, deafferentiation and non "tic-like" pains. This may be due to the asynchronous spatial temporal dispersion of abnormal centrally-propagating axonal activity in nociceptive and non-nociceptive fibers from the region of pathology. This is opposed to the putative synchronous multifiber volleys which may emanate from the proximal trigeminal REZ in patients with typical trigeminal neuralgia. It appears that classical trigeminal neuralgia may be an exception to the rule that nerve injuries typically produce symptoms like constant pain and allodynia. Trigeminal neuropathic pain is, in some ways, a more general syndrome in that it is a painful nerve injury of the distal trigeminal nerve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Using functional imaging, we recently investigated how repeated painful stimulation over several days is processed, perceived and modulated in the healthy human brain. Considering that activation-dependent brain plasticity in humans on a structural level has already been demonstrated in adults, we were interested in whether repeated painful stimulation may lead to structural changes of the brain. 14 healthy subjects were stimulated daily with a 20 min pain paradigm for 8 consecutive days, using structural MRI performed on days 1, 8, 22 and again after 1 year. Using voxel based morphometry, we are able to show that repeated painful stimulation resulted in a substantial increase of gray matter in pain transmitting areas, including mid-cingulate and somatosensory cortex. These changes are stimulation dependent, i.e. they recede after the regular nociceptive input is stopped. This data raises some interesting questions regarding structural plasticity of the brain concerning the experience of both acute and chronic pain},

The protocols were refined by several iterations of intra- and inter-rater measurements and identification of sources of variability. Reproducibility of the established protocols was then tested by raters who did not have previous experience in tractography. The protocols were applied to a DTI database of adult normal subjects to study size, fractional anisotropy (FA), and T2 of individual white matter tracts. Distinctive features in FA and T2 were found for the corticospinal tract and callosal fibers. Hemispheric asymmetry was observed for the size of white matter tracts projecting to the temporal lobe.

abstract = {Purpose To enable high-quality correction of susceptibility-induced geometric distortion artifacts in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images without increasing scan time. Theory and Methods A new method for distortion correction is proposed based on subsampling a generalized version of the state-of-the-art reversed-gradient distortion correction method. Rather than acquire each q-space sample multiple times with different distortions (as in the conventional reversed-gradient method), we sample each q-space point once with an interlaced sampling scheme that measures different distortions at different q-space locations. Distortion correction is achieved using a novel constrained reconstruction formulation that leverages the smoothness of diffusion data in q-space. Results The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulated and in vivo diffusion MRI data. The proposed method is substantially faster than the reversed-gradient method, and can also provide smaller intensity errors in the corrected images and smaller errors in derived quantitative diffusion parameters. Conclusion The proposed method enables state-of-the-art distortion correction performance without increasing data acquisition time.

abstract = {This paper presents processing and visualization techniques for Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI). In DT-MRI, each voxel is assigned a tensor that describes local water diffusion. The geometric nature of diffusion tensors enables us to quantitatively characterize the local structure in tissues such as bone, muscle, and white matter of the brain. This makes DT-MRI an interesting modality for image analysis. In this paper we present a novel analytical solution to the Stejskal-Tanner diffusion equation system whereby a dual tensor basis, derived from the diffusion sensitizing gradient configuration, eliminates the need to solve this equation for each voxel. We further describe decomposition of the diffusion tensor based on its symmetrical properties, which in turn describe the geometry of the diffusion ellipsoid. A simple anisotropy measure follows naturally from this analysis. We describe how the geometry or shape of the tensor can be visualized using a coloring scheme based on the derived shape measures. In addition, we demonstrate that human brain tensor data when filtered can effectively describe macrostructural diffusion, which is important in the assessment of fiber-tract organization. We also describe how white matter pathways can be monitored with the methods introduced in this paper. DT-MRI tractography is useful for demonstrating neural connectivity (in vivo) in healthy and diseased brain tissue.},

However, the molecular signals required for the initiation of myelination are largely unknown. Ishibashi et al. report in this issue of Neuron that ATP released by axons as a result of electrical stimulation serves as an important myelination signal. Surprisingly, they found that ATP does not act directly on oligodendrocytes but rather on astrocytes, causing the release of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which in turns affects promyelinating oligodendrocytes. These findings uncover a novel role for astrocytes in mediating the intricate communication between axons and myelinating glial cells.},

@article{Tanum2001,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between personality and reported pain and somatic distress in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGD) without psychopathology. METHODS: Fifty-six patients and 55 controls completed Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI), NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ: N+L scales), and Giessener Physical Complaints Checklist (GBB). Patients also completed McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for abdominal pain and target symptom (abdominal distress). RESULTS: Patients displayed significantly higher levels of neuroticism and covert aggression than controls. Number of words chosen (NWC) to describe pain and sensory pain index (MPQ), but not pain intensity on VAS, were predicted by indirect aggression -- and less so by neuroticism -- in females and covert aggression in males (stepwise regression model). Patients reported far more extraintestinal somatic complaints than controls. CONCLUSION: Out of nine dimensions of hostility and five dimensions of personality, only neuroticism and concealed aggression are increased in FGD patients without psychiatric comorbidity compared with healthy controls. These personality traits influence pain reports and should be taken into account when evaluating and treating patients with FGD. Neuroticism and concealed aggression are most likely markers of vulnerability to FGD and not merely reflections of being chronic ill or explained by sample bias secondary to illness behavior},

abstract = {The insula and cingulate cortices are implicated in emotional, homeostatic/allostatic, sensorimotor, and cognitive functions. Non-human primates have specific anatomical connections between sub-divisions of the insula and cingulate. Specifically, the anterior insula projects to the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) and the anterior and posterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC and pMCC); the mid-posterior insula only projects to the posterior MCC (pMCC). In humans, functional neuroimaging studies implicate the anterior insula and pre/subgenual ACC in emotional processes, the mid-posterior insula with awareness and interoception, and the MCC with environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that distinct resting state functional connectivity could be identified between (1) the anterior insula and pACC/aMCC; and (2) the entire insula (anterior, middle, and posterior insula) and the pMCC. Functional connectivity was assessed from resting state fMRI scans in 19 healthy volunteers using seed regions of interest in the anterior, middle, and posterior insula. Highly correlated, low-frequency oscillations ({\textless} 0.05 Hz) were identified between specific insula and cingulate subdivisions. The anterior insula was shown to be functionally connected with the pACC/aMCC and the pMCC, while the mid/posterior insula was only connected with the pMCC. These data provide evidence for a resting state anterior insula-pACC/aMCC cingulate system that may integrate interoceptive information with emotional salience to form a subjective representation of the body; and another system that includes the entire insula and MCC, likely involved in environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation.},

abstract = {The human insular cortex forms a distinct, but entirely hidden lobe, situated in the depth of the Sylvian fissure. Here, we first review the recent literature on the connectivity and the functions of this structure. It appears that this small lobe, taking up less than 2{\%} of the total cortical surface area, receives afferents from some sensory thalamic nuclei, is (mostly reciprocally) connected with the amygdala and with many limbic and association cortical areas, and is implicated in an astonishingly large number of widely different functions, ranging from pain perception and speech production to the processing of social emotions. Next, we embark on a long, adventurous journey through the voluminous literature on the structural organization of the insular cortex. This journey yielded the following take-home messages: (1) The meticulous, but mostly neglected publications of Rose (1928) and Brockhaus (1940) are still invaluable for our understanding of the architecture of the mammalian insular cortex. (2) The relation of the insular cortex to the adjacent claustrum is neither ontogenetical nor functional, but purely topographical. (3) The insular cortex has passed through a spectacular progressive differentiation during hominoid evolution, but the assumption of Craig (2009) that the human anterior insula has no homologue in the rhesus monkey is untenable. (4) The concept of Mesulam and Mufson (1985), that the primate insula is essentially composed of three concentrically arranged zones, agranular, dysgranular, and granular, is presumably correct, but there is at present much confusion concerning the more detailed architecture of the anterior insular cortex. (5) The large spindle-shaped cells in the fifth layer of the insular cortex, currently known as von Economo neurons (VENs), are not only confined to large-brained mammals, such as whales, elephants, apes, and humans, but also occur in monkeys and prosimians, as well as in the pygmy hippopotamus, the Atlantic walrus, and Florida manatee. Finally, we point out that the human insula presents a unique opportunity for performing an in-depth comparative analysis of the relations between structure and function in a typical sensory and a typical cognitive cortical domain.},

Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and investigated brain processing associated with cutaneous sympathetic vasoconstrictor reflexes during noxious stimulation. When a classical fMRI analysis based on the applied block design was performed, we were able to detect activations well known to be engaged in the central processing of touch and pain. A parametric fMRI analysis in which cutaneous vasoconstrictor activity was correlated with MRI signals revealed two distinct patterns of brain activity. During (i) noxious stimulation itself, brain activity correlated with sympathetic activity in the anterior insula, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). During (ii) baseline, brain activity correlated with sympathetic activity in the VMPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), OFC, PCC, cuneus, precuneus, occipital areas, and hypothalamus. Conjunction analysis revealed significant similar responses during periods of noxious stimulation and periods of sympathetic activation in the anterior insula, ACC and VLPFC (activation) and VMPFC, OFC, PCC, cuneus and precuneus (deactivation). Therefore, we here describe a cerebral network which may be engaged in the processing of the autonomic subdimension of the human pain experience.},

First, a continuous diffusion tensor field is constructed from this discrete, noisy, measured DT-MRI data. Then a Frenet equation, describing the evolution of a fiber tract, was solved. This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades where the distribution of fiber tract directions is nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The insula is important for gustatory sensation, motor speech control, vestibular function, and sympathetic control of cardiovascular tone. The purpose of this study was to test two hypotheses: 1) gross anatomic study of the insula will disclose reproducible patterns of insular structure, and 2) analysis of MR appearance will enable physicians to recognize these patterns on imaging studies. METHODS: Gross insular anatomy was determined in 16 normal human cadaveric hemispheres. The 1.5-T MR images of 300 insulae were analyzed to determine the gyral and sulcal patterns displayed; their relationship to the Heschl gyrus, to the overlying opercula, and to the vertical planes perpendicular to the Talairach-Tournoux baseline at the anterior commissure (VAC) and posterior commissure (VPC); their continuity into the orbitofrontal cortex; and appropriate landmarks for the anterior border, apex, and posterior border of the insula. RESULTS: MR images displayed the central sulcus of the insula (97{\%}); the anterior (99{\%}), middle (78{\%}), and posterior (98{\%}) short insular gyri that converge to the apex (100{\%}) anteriorly; and the anterior (99{\%}) and posterior (58{\%}) long insular gyri posteriorly. The middle short gyrus was often hypoplastic (33{\%}). The anterior intersections of the internal and external capsules typically delimit the anterior insular border (87{\%}). VAC intersects the anterior insula (99{\%}), usually at the precentral sulcus. The Heschl gyrus circumscribes the posteroinferior insula (100{\%}). VPC demarcates the posterior insular border (94{\%}). CONCLUSION: The two hypotheses were proved correct. The insula shows reproducible patterns of gross anatomy that are demonstrable on routine clinical MR images obtained at 1.5 T.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Self-critical perfectionistic personality features have been shown to influence the onset and perpetuation of pain symptoms. However, no study to date has investigated whether these personality features are associated with treatment response in chronic pain. METHODS: Using a naturalistic pre-post design, the present study examined the effect of self-critical perfectionism on treatment outcome in terms of self-reported pain. The study was conducted in a sample of 53 chronic non-cancer pain patients who followed Multidisciplinary Pain Education Program (MPEP), a brief, 2-week cognitive-behaviorally based psycho-educational intervention for chronic pain that was recently found to be effective in reducing pain severity. Pre- and post-treatment pain intensity levels were assessed with the visual analog scale of the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form. RESULTS: Pretreatment self-critical perfectionism was significantly associated with negative treatment outcome, even after taking into account pretreatment levels of depression. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that self-critical perfectionistic personality features may negatively interfere with treatment response in patients with chronic pain. Thus, findings indicate that chronic pain patients with high levels of self-critical perfectionism may benefit less from brief interventions such as MPEP, and therefore may need more intensive and tailored treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In migraine patients, functional imaging studies have shown changes in several brain gray matter (GM) regions. However, 1.5-T MRI has failed to detect any structural abnormality of these regions. We used a 3-T MRI scanner and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess whether GM density abnormalities can be seen in patients with migraine with T2-visible abnormalities and to grade their extent. METHODS: In 16 migraine patients with T2-visible abnormalities and 15 matched controls, we acquired a T2-weighted and a high-resolution T1-weighted sequence. Lesion loads were measured on T2-weighted images. An optimized version of VBM analysis was used to assess regional differences in GM densities on T1-weighted scans of patients versus controls. Statistical parametric maps were thresholded at P{\textless}0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Compared with controls, migraine patients had areas of reduced GM density, mainly located in the frontal and temporal lobes. Conversely, patients showed increased periacqueductal GM (PAG) density. Compared with patients without aura, migraine patients with aura had increased density of the PAG and of the dorsolateral pons. In migraine patients, reduced GM density was strongly related to age, disease duration, and T2-visible lesion load (r ranging from -0.84 to -0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Structural GM abnormalities can be detected in migraine patients with brain T2-visible lesions using VBM and a high-field MRI scanner. Such GM changes comprise areas with reduced and increased density and are likely related to the pathological substrates associated with this disease},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional and structural substrates of motor network dysfunction in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: Using a 3-T scanner, in 12 right-handed RRMS patients and 14 matched controls, we acquired diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and functional MRI during the performance of a simple motor task with the right (R) hand. Using DT MRI tractography, we calculated DT-derived metrics from several motor and nonmotor white matter (WM) fiber bundles. Functional connectivity analysis was performed using SPM2. RESULTS: Compared with control, MS patients had abnormal DT MRI metrics of all the WM bundles studied. Compared with controls, MS patients had more significant activations of the left (L) supplementary motor area (SMA), the L primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), and the R cerebellum. They also had increased functional connectivity between the R primary SMC and the R cerebellum (p = 0.01) and the L SMA and the L primary SMC (p = 0.04). Coefficients of altered connectivity were correlated with structural MRI metrics of tissue damage of the corticospinal and the dentatorubrothalamic tract (r values ranging from -0.73 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The correlations found between measures of functional connectivity and structural damage to some of the major brain motor white matter bundles suggest an adaptive role of functional connectivity changes in limiting the clinical consequences of structural damage in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Combining measures of altered functional and structural connectivities of specific brain networks is a promising tool to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for clinical manifestations of CNS damage},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: No prospective study of gamma knife thalamotomy for intractable tremor has previously been reported. OBJECTIVE:: To clarify the safety and optimally effective conditions for performing unilateral gamma knife (GK) thalamotomy for tremors of Parkinson disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET), a systematic postirradiation 24-month follow-up study was conducted at 6 institutions. We present the results of this multicenter collaborative trial. METHODS:: In total, 72 patients (PD characterized by tremor, n = 59; ET, n = 13) were registered at 6 Japanese institutions. Following our selective thalamotomy procedure, the lateral part of the ventralis intermedius nucleus, 45{\%} of the thalamic length from the anterior tip, was selected as the GK isocenter. A single 130-Gy shot was applied using a 4-mm collimator. Evaluation included neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging and/or computerized tomography, the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), electromyography, medication change, and video observations. RESULTS:: Final clinical effects were favorable. Of 53 patients who completed 24 months of follow-up, 43 were evaluated as having excellent or good results (81.1{\%}). UPDRS scores showed tremor improvement (parts II and III). Thalamic lesion size fluctuated but converged to either an almost spherical shape (65.6{\%}), a sphere with streaking (23.4{\%}), or an extended high-signal zone (10.9{\%}). No permanent clinical complications were observed. CONCLUSION:: GK thalamotomy is an alternative treatment for intractable tremors of PD as well as for ET. Less invasive intervention may be beneficial to patients.},

First, theoretical considerations show why and under what conditions diffusion contrast is positive. Using this result, spin displacement spectra that are conventionally phase-encoded can be accurately reconstructed by a Fourier transform of the measured signal's modulus. Second, studies of in vitro and in vivo samples demonstrate correspondence between the orientational maxima of the diffusion spectrum and those of the fiber orientation density at each location. In specimens with complex muscular tissue, such as the tongue, diffusion spectrum images show characteristic local heterogeneities of fiber architectures, including angular dispersion and intersection. Cerebral diffusion spectra acquired in normal human subjects resolve known white matter tracts and tract intersections. Finally, the relation between the presented model-free imaging technique and other available diffusion MRI schemes is discussed.},

abstract = {There is increasing pressure from the general public, clinical and scientific circles, insurance companies, and legal, government, and military agencies to adopt brain imaging for chronic pain and other health-related diagnostics [27]. Brain imaging is being considered as a diagnostic tool for neurological and psychiatric conditions, particularly for conditions that by their very nature rely on self-report. However, in our experience, we find that most clinicians and other stakeholders do not have a sufficient understanding of the limitations of the technology, despite the enormous impact its misuse could have. The diagnosis of chronic pain can be particularly challenging because, by definition, pain is a subjective experience. Thus, chronic pain ‘‘biomarkers'' or ‘‘predictors'' based on brain imaging findings are being sought. Such applications require clear understanding of the technical and physiological capabilities of brain imaging as well as ethical and policy considerations. This review highlights limitations of single-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the need to address public understanding of neuroimaging and responsibility of researchers, patient vulnerability, regulatory issues, and discrimination.},

abstract = {A magnetic resonance imaging method is presented for quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter, reflecting the structural differences between these two types of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},

To prepare deep learning for industry uptake and practical applications, neural networks will require large data sets that represent all possible driving environments and scenarios. We collect a large data set of highway data and apply deep learning and computer vision algorithms to problems such as car and lane detection. We show how existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to perform lane and vehicle detection while running at frame rates required for a real-time system.

abstract = {Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is commonly used for treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors; however, cognitive impairment occurs in 40-50{\%} of brain tumor survivors. The etiology of the cognitive impairment following WBRT remains elusive. We recently reported that radiation-induced cerebrovascular rarefaction within hippocampal subregions could be completely reversed by systemic hypoxia. However, the effects of this intervention on learning and memory have not been reported. In this study, we assessed the time-course for WBRT-induced impairments in contextual and spatial learning and the capacity of systemic hypoxia to reverse WBRT-induced deficits in spatial memory. A clinical fractionated series of 4.5Gy WBRT was administered to mice twice weekly for 4 weeks, and after various periods of recovery, behavioral analyses were performed. To study the effects of systemic hypoxia, mice were subjected to 11{\%} (hypoxia) or 21{\%} oxygen (normoxia) for 28 days, initiated 1 month after the completion of WBRT. Our results indicate that WBRT induces a transient deficit in contextual learning, disruption of working memory, and progressive impairment of spatial learning. Additionally, systemic hypoxia completely reversed WBRT-induced impairments in learning and these behavioral effects as well as increased vessel density persisted for at least 2 months following hypoxia treatment. Our results provide critical support for the hypothesis that cerebrovascular rarefaction is a key component of cognitive impairment post-WBRT and indicate that processes of learning and memory, once thought to be permanently impaired after WBRT, can be restored.},

abstract = {Unraveling the energy metabolism and the hemodynamic outcomes of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity is critical not only for our basic understanding of overall brain function, but also for the understanding of many brain disorders. Methodologies of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are powerful tools for the noninvasive investigation of brain metabolism and physiology. However, the temporal and spatial resolution of in vivo MRS and MRI is not suitable to provide direct evidence for hypotheses that involve metabolic compartmentalization between different cell types, or to untangle the complex neuronal microcircuitry, which results in changes of electrical activity. This review aims at describing how the current models of brain metabolism, mainly built on the basis of in vitro evidence, relate to experimental findings recently obtained in vivo by (1)H MRS, (13)C MRS, and MRI. The hypotheses related to the role of different metabolic substrates, the metabolic neuron-glia interactions, along with the available theoretical predictions of the energy budget of neurotransmission will be discussed. In addition, the cellular and network mechanisms that characterize different types of increased and suppressed neuronal activity will be considered within the sensitivity-constraints of MRS and MRI.},

abstract = {In multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain is a frequent condition, negatively influencing the overall quality of life. Cranial neuralgias, including trigeminal, glossopharyngeal neuralgias, as well as occipital neuralgia, are typical expression of neuropathic pain. Neuralgias are characterised by paroxysmal painful attacks of electric shock-like sensation, occurring spontaneously or evoked by innocuous stimuli in specific trigger areas. In multiple sclerosis, demyelination in the centrally myelinated part of the cranial nerve roots plays an important role in the origin of neuralgic pain. These painful syndromes arising in multiple sclerosis are therefore considered "symptomatic", in contrast to classic cranial neuralgias, in which no cause other than a neurovascular contact is identified. At this time, the evidence on the management of symptomatic cranial neuralgias in multiple sclerosis is fragmentary and a comprehensive review addressing this topic is still lacking. For that reason, treatment is often based on personal clinical experience as well as on anecdotal reports. The aim of this review is to critically summarise the latest findings regarding the pathogenesis, the diagnosis, the instrumental evaluation and the medical as well as neurosurgical treatment of symptomatic trigeminal, glossopharyngeal and occipital neuralgia in multiple sclerosis, providing useful insights for neurologists and neurosurgeons and a broad range of specialists potentially involved in the treatment of these painful syndromes.},

abstract = {Pain is more common in multiple sclerosis (MS) than has previously been recognised. In the present study we have investigated the occurrence of central pain (CP) in MS and defined its characteristics. Questionnaires were sent to all 429 patients with definite MS in the patient register at our neurology department. All admitting to pain were interviewed and offered an extended interview and examination. Three hundred and sixty four patients responded (86{\%}), of whom 57.5{\%} reported pain during the course of their disease (21{\%} nociceptive, 2{\%} peripheral neuropathic and 1{\%} related to spasticity). One hundred patients (27.5{\%}) had CP, including 18 patients (4.9{\%}) with trigeminal neuralgia. The non-trigeminal CP was, in 87{\%}, located in the lower and in 31{\%} in the upper extremities. It was mostly bilateral (76{\%}) and constant, with 88{\%} experiencing daily pain. Only 2{\%} had paroxysmal attacks. Aching, burning, pricking were the commonest qualities. The pain was intense with small to moderate spontaneous variation. In 5.5{\%} of all patients (20{\%} of the patients with CP), pain was a presenting symptom, alone or in combination with other symptoms. The most common neurological symptoms/signs besides CP were sensory abnormalities (98{\%}, dominated by abnormal sensibility to painful stimulus and temperature). Trigeminal neuralgia in MS started later in life and after longer disease duration than non-trigeminal pain. Both types of CP existed either chronically or as a feature of relapse. Central pain is thus an important symptom in MS (around 30{\%}) and causes much suffering.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression is an etiological strategy for the therapy of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Preoperative identification of neurovascular compression, therefore, could have an impact on the determination of appropriate treatment for TN. PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of contrast-enhanced and unenhanced three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography in the visualization of neurovascular relationship in patients with TN. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with unilateral TN underwent unenhanced and contrast-enhanced 3D TOF MR angiography with a 3.0-T MR system. Images were reviewed by a radiologist blinded to clinical details. Vascular contact with the trigeminal nerve was identified, and the nature of the involved vessels (artery or vein) was determined. All patients underwent microvascular decompression. RESULTS: In 37 patients with TN, contrast-enhanced 3D TOF MR angiography identified surgically verified neurovascular contact in 35 of 36 symptomatic nerves, and there was no false-positive. Based on surgical findings, the sensitivity of MR imaging was 97.2{\%} and specificity 100{\%}. The nature of the offending vessel was correctly identified in 94.4{\%} of the patients by using the combination of contrast-enhanced and unenhanced MR angiography. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced 3D TOF MR angiography is useful in the detection of vascular contact with the trigeminal nerve in patients with TN, and this MR imaging in combination with unenhanced MR angiography could help in the identification of the nature of the responsible vessels},

abstract = {To study the properties of human primary somatosensory (S1) cortex as well as its role in cognitive and social processes, it is necessary to noninvasively localize the cortical representations of the body. Being arguably the most relevant body parts for tactile exploration, cortical representations of fingers are of particular interest. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cortical representation of individual fingers (D1-D5), using human touch as a stimulus. Utilizing the high BOLD sensitivity and spatial resolution at 7T, we found that each finger is represented within three subregions of S1 in the postcentral gyrus. Within each of these three areas, the fingers are sequentially organized (from D1 to D5) in a somatotopic manner. Therefore, these finger representations likely reflect distinct activations of BAs 3b, 1, and 2, similar to those described in electrophysiological work in non-human primates. Quantitative analysis of the local BOLD responses revealed that within BA3b, each finger representation is specific to its own stimulation without any cross-finger responsiveness. This finger response selectivity was less prominent in BA 1 and in BA 2. A test-retest procedure highlighted the reproducibility of the results and the robustness of the method for BA 3b. Finally, the representation of the thumb was enlarged compared to the other fingers within BAs 1 and 2. These findings extend previous human electrophysiological and neuroimaging data but also reveal differences in the functional organization of S1 in human and nonhuman primates.},

In analyzing fMRI measurements designed to resolve these issues, we discovered a significant problem that afflicts measurements from ventral occipital cortex, and particularly measurements near hV4. In most hemispheres the fMRI hV4 data are contaminated by artifacts from the transverse sinus (TS). We created a model of the TS artifact and showed that the model predicts the locations of anomalous fMRI responses to simple large-field on-off stimuli. In many subjects, and particularly the left hemisphere, the TS artifact masks fMRI responses specifically in the region of cortex that distinguishes the two main hV4 models. By selecting subjects with a TS displaced from the lateral edge of hV4, we were able to see around the vein. In these subjects, the visual field coverage extends to the lower meridian, or nearly so, consistent with a model in which hV4 is located on the ventral surface and responds to signals throughout the full contralateral hemifield.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the neural correlates of pain perception in humans has increased significantly since the advent of neuroimaging. Relating neural activity changes to the varied pain experiences has led to an increased awareness of how factors (e.g., cognition, emotion, context, injury) can separately influence pain perception. Tying this body of knowledge in humans to work in animal models of pain provides an opportunity to determine common features that reliably contribute to pain perception and its modulation. One key system that underpins the ability to change pain intensity is the brainstem's descending modulatory network with its pro- and antinociceptive components. We discuss not only the latest data describing the cerebral signature of pain and its modulation in humans, but also suggest that the brainstem plays a pivotal role in gating the degree of nociceptive transmission so that the resultant pain experienced is appropriate for the particular situation of the individual.},

To examine this hypothesis, I first review findings on micro-structural dynamics with focus on the extension and retraction of dendritic spines. Although these observations demonstrate a biological mechanism, they do not inform us of the specific changes in circuit configuration that might occur during learning. Here, computational models have made testable predictions for both the neuronal and circuit levels. Integrative approaches in the mammalian neocortex and the barn owl auditory localization pathway provide some of the first direct evidence in support of these 'synaptic-clustering' mechanisms. The implications of these data and the challenges for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {Whilst recent neuroimaging studies have identified a series of different brain regions as being involved in empathy, it remains unclear concerning the activation consistence of these brain regions and their specific functional roles. Using MKDA, a whole-brain based quantitative meta-analysis of recent fMRI studies of empathy was performed. This analysis identified the dACC-aMCC-SMA and bilateral anterior insula as being consistently activated in empathy. Hypothesizing that what are here termed affective-perceptual and cognitive-evaluative forms of empathy might be characterized by different activity patterns, the neural activations in these forms of empathy were compared. The dorsal aMCC was demonstrated to be recruited more frequently in the cognitive-evaluative form of empathy, whilst the right anterior insula was found to be involved in the affective-perceptual form of empathy only. The left anterior insula was active in both forms of empathy. It was concluded that the dACC-aMCC-SMA and bilateral insula can be considered as forming a core network in empathy, and that cognitive-evaluative and affective-perceptual empathy can be distinguished at the level of regional activation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The purpose of a classification scheme like this is to advocate a more rigorous, standardized natural history and outcome studies for TN and related facial pain syndromes.},

abstract = {Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a prevalent chronic pain disorder that remains poorly understood. Recent imaging studies reported functional and gray matter abnormalities in brain areas implicated in sensorimotor, modulatory, and cognitive function in TMD, but it is not known whether there are white matter (WM) abnormalities along the trigeminal nerve (CNV) or in the brain. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging, and found that, compared to healthy controls, TMD patients had 1) lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in both CNVs; 2) a negative correlation between FA of the right CNV and pain duration; and 3) diffuse abnormalities in the microstructure of WM tracts related to sensory, motor, cognitive, and pain functions, with a highly significant focal abnormality in the corpus callosum. Using probabilistic tractography, we found that the corpus callosum in patients had a higher connection probability to the frontal pole, and a lower connection probability to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, compared to controls. Finally, we found that 1) FA in tracts adjacent to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and tracts coursing through the thalamus negatively correlated with pain intensity; 2) FA in the internal capsule negatively correlated with pain intensity and unpleasantness; and 3) decreases in brain FA were associated with increases in mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity, markers of inflammation and oedema. These data provide novel evidence for CNV microstructural abnormalities that may be caused by increased nociceptive activity, accompanied by abnormalities along central WM pathways in TMD.},

abstract = {Regions of the human temporal lobe show greater activation for speech than for other sounds. These differences may reflect intrinsically specialized domain-specific adaptations for processing speech, or they may be driven by the significant expertise we have in listening to the speech signal. To test the expertise hypothesis, we used a video-game-based paradigm that tacitly trained listeners to categorize acoustically complex, artificial nonlinguistic sounds. Before and after training, we used functional MRI to measure how expertise with these sounds modulated temporal lobe activation. Participants' ability to explicitly categorize the nonspeech sounds predicted the change in pretraining to posttraining activation in speech-sensitive regions of the left posterior superior temporal sulcus, suggesting that emergent auditory expertise may help drive this functional regionalization. Thus, seemingly domain-specific patterns of neural activation in higher cortical regions may be driven in part by experience-based restructuring of high-dimensional perceptual space.},

abstract = {Clinical audits have highlighted the many challenges and dilemmas faced by clinicians assessing persons with disorders of consciousness (vegetative state and minimally conscious state). The diagnostic decision-making process is highly subjective, dependent upon the skills of the examiner and invariably dictated by the patients' ability to move or speak. Whilst a considerable amount has been learnt since Jennett and Plum coined the term 'vegetative state', the assessment process remains largely unchanged; conducted at the bedside, using behavioural assessment tools, which are susceptible to environmental and physiological factors. This has created a situation where the rate of misdiagnosis is unacceptably high (up to 43{\%}). In order to address these problems, various functional brain imaging paradigms, which do not rely upon the patient's ability to move or speak, have been proposed as a source of additional information to inform the diagnostic decision making process. Although accumulated evidence from brain imaging, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has been encouraging, the empirical evidence is still based on relatively small numbers of patients. It remains unclear whether brain imaging is capable of informing the diagnosis beyond the behavioural assessment and whether brain imaging has any prognostic utility. In this study, we describe the functional brain imaging findings from a group of 41 patients with disorders of consciousness, who undertook a hierarchical speech processing task. We found, contrary to the clinical impression of a specialist team using behavioural assessment tools, that two patients referred to the study with a diagnosis of vegetative state did in fact demonstrate neural correlates of speech comprehension when assessed using functional brain imaging. These fMRI findings were found to have no association with the patient's behavioural presentation at the time of investigation and thus provided additional diagnostic information beyond the traditional clinical assessment. Notably, the utility of brain imaging was further underlined by the finding that the level of auditory processing revealed by functional brain imaging, correlated strongly (rs = 0.81, P {\textless} 0.001) with the patient's subsequent behavioural recovery, 6 months after the scan, suggesting that brain imaging may also provide valuable prognostic information. Although further evidence is required before consensus statements can be made regarding the use of brain imaging in clinical decision making for disorders of consciousness, the results from this study clearly highlight the potential of imaging to inform the diagnostic decision-making process for persons with disorders of consciousness.},

abstract = {Human minds often wander away from their immediate sensory environment. It remains unknown whether such mind wandering is unsystematic or whether it lawfully relates to an individual's tendency to attend to salient stimuli such as pain and their associated brain structure/function. Studies of pain-cognition interactions typically examine explicit manipulation of attention rather than spontaneous mind wandering. Here we sought to better represent natural fluctuations in pain in daily life, so we assessed behavioral and neural aspects of spontaneous disengagement of attention from pain. We found that an individual's tendency to attend to pain related to the disruptive effect of pain on his or her cognitive task performance. Next, we linked behavioral findings to neural networks with strikingly convergent evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging during pain coupled with thought probes of mind wandering, dynamic resting state activity fluctuations, and diffusion MRI. We found that (i) pain-induced default mode network (DMN) deactivations were attenuated during mind wandering away from pain; (ii) functional connectivity fluctuations between the DMN and periaqueductal gray (PAG) dynamically tracked spontaneous attention away from pain; and (iii) across individuals, stronger PAG-DMN structural connectivity and more dynamic resting state PAG-DMN functional connectivity were associated with the tendency to mind wander away from pain. These data demonstrate that individual tendencies to mind wander away from pain, in the absence of explicit manipulation, are subserved by functional and structural connectivity within and between default mode and antinociceptive descending modulation networks.},

abstract = {The ability to retrieve temporal and spatial context information from memory declines with healthy aging. The hippocampus (HC) has been shown to be associated with successful encoding and retrieval of spatio-temporal context, versus item recognition information (Davachi, Mitchell, {\&} Wagner, 2003; Nadel, Samsonovich, Ryan, {\&} Moscovitch, 2000; Ross {\&} Slotnick, 2008). Aging has been linked to volume reduction in the HC (Bouchard, Malykhin, Martin, Hanstock, Emery, Fisher, {\&} Camicioli, 2008; Malykhin, Bouchard, Camicioli, {\&} Coupland, 2008; Raz et al., 2005). As such, age-associated reductions in anterior HC volume may contribute to the context memory deficits observed in older adults. In the current MRI study we investigated whether item recognition, spatial context and temporal context memory performance would be predicted by regional volumes in HC head (HH), body (HB) and tail (HT) volumes, using within group multiple regression analyses in a sample of 19 healthy young (mean age 24.3) and 20 older adults (mean age 67.7). We further examined between age-group differences in the volumes of the same HC sub-regions. Multiple regression analyses revealed that in younger adults both spatial and temporal context retrieval performance was predicted by anterior HC volume. Older age was associated with significant volume reductions in HH and HB, but not HT; and with reduced ability to retrieve spatial and temporal contextual details from episodic memory. However, HC volumes did not predict context retrieval performance in older adults. We conclude that individual differences in anterior, not posterior, HC volumes predict context memory performance in young adults. With age there may be a posterior-to-anterior shift from using HC-related processes, due to HC volume loss, to employing the prefrontal cortex to aid in the performance of cognitively demanding context memory tasks. However, due to concomitant changes in the prefrontal system with age, there are limits to compensation in the aging brain.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using variable diffusion times (t(diff)) was performed to investigate wild-type (wt) mice, myelin-deficient shiverer (shi) mutant mice and shi mice transplanted with wt neural precursor cells that differentiate and function as oligodendrocytes. At t(diff) = 30 ms, the diffusion anisotropy "volume ratio" (VR), diffusion perpendicular to the fibers (lambda( perpendicular)), and mean apparent diffusion coefficient ({\textless}D{\textgreater}) of the corpus callosum of shi mice were significantly higher than those of wt mice by 12 +/- 2{\%}, 13 +/- 2{\%}, and 10 +/- 1{\%}, respectively; fractional anisotropy (FA) and relative anisotropy (RA) were lower by 10 +/- 1{\%} and 11 +/- 3{\%}, respectively. Diffusion parallel to the fibers (lambda(//)) was not statistically different between shi and wt mice. Normalized T(2)-weighted signal intensities showed obvious differences (27 +/- 4{\%}) between wt and shi mice in the corpus callosum but surprisingly did not detect transplant-derived myelination. In contrast, diffusion anisotropy maps detected transplant-derived myelination in the corpus callosum and its spatial distribution was consistent with the donor-derived myelination determined by immunohistochemical staining. Anisotropy indices (except lambda(//)) in the corpus callosum showed strong t(diff) dependence (30-280 ms), and the differences in lambda( perpendicular) and VR between wt and shi mice became significantly larger at longer t(diff), indicative of improved DTI sensitivity at long t(diff). In contrast, anisotropy indices in the hippocampus showed very weak t(diff) dependence and were not significantly different between wt and shi mice across different t(diff). This study provides insights into the biological signal sources and measurement parameters influencing DTI contrast, which could lead to developing more sensitive techniques for detection of demyelinating diseases},

Modern lesion analyses techniques in such patients and recent neuroimaging results in healthy subjects suggest a prominent role of the right insula for our sense of limb ownership as well as for our feeling of being involved in a movement-our sense of agency.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diffuse excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI) is observed in the majority of preterm infants at term-equivalent age on conventional MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging has shown that apparent diffusion coefficient values are elevated in the white matter (WM) in DEHSI. Our aim was to obtain diffusion tensor imaging on preterm infants at term-equivalent age and term control infants to test the hypothesis that radial diffusivity was significantly different in the WM in preterm infants with DEHSI compared with both preterm infants with normal-appearing WM on conventional MRI and term control infants. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging was obtained on 38 preterm infants at term-equivalent age and 8 term control infants. Values for axial (lambda1) and radial [(lambda2 + lambda3)/2] diffusivity were calculated in regions of interest positioned in the central WM at the level of the centrum semiovale, frontal WM, posterior periventricular WM, occipital WM, anterior and posterior portions of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. RESULTS: Radial diffusivity was elevated significantly in the posterior portion of the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the splenium of the corpus callosum, and both axial and radial diffusivity were elevated significantly in the WM at the level of the centrum semiovale, the frontal WM, the periventricular WM, and the occipital WM in preterm infants with DEHSI compared with preterm infants with normal-appearing WM and term control infants. There was no significant difference between term control infants and preterm infants with normal-appearing WM in any region studied. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that DEHSI represents an oligodendrocyte and/or axonal abnormality that is widespread throughout the cerebral WM.},

abstract = {1. Recordings were made from the caudal part of the ventral posterior lateral (VPLc) nucleus of the thalamus in anesthetized macaque monkeys. In additon to many neurons that responded only to weak mechanical stimuli, scattered neurons were found that responded to both innocuous and noxious stimulation or just to noxious stimulation of the skin. A total of 73 such neurons were examined in 26 animals. 2. Noxious stimuli included strong mechanical stimuli (pressure, pinch, and squeezing with forceps) and graded noxious heat (from 35 degrees C adapting temperature to 43, 45, 47, and 50 degrees C). The responses of the VPLc neurons increased progressively with greater intensities of noxious stimulation. The stimulus-response function when noxious heat stimuli were used was a power function with an exponent greater than one. 3. Repetition of the noxious heat stimuli revealed sensitization of the responses of the thalamic neurons to such stimuli. The threshold for a response to noxious heat was lowered, and the responses to supra-threshold noxious heat stimuli were enhanced. 4. The responses of VPLc neurons to noxious heat stimuli adapted after reaching a peak discharge frequency. The rate of adaptation was slower for a stimulus of 50 degrees C than for one of 47 degrees C. 5. For the six neurons tested, responses to noxious heat were dependent on pathways ascending in the ventral part of the lateral funiculus contralateral to the receptive field (ipsilateral to the thalamic neuron). In two cases, the input to the thalamic neurons from axons of the dorsal column was also conveyed by way of a crossed pathway in the opposite ventral quadrant. In another case, access to the thalamic neuron by way of ascending dorsal column fibers was demonstrated. 6. The thalamic neurons had restricted contralateral receptive fields that were somatotopically organized. Neurons with receptive fields on the hindlimb were in the lateral part of the VPLc nucleus, whereas neurons with receptive fields on the forelimb were in medial VPLc. 7. Ninety percent of the VPLc neurons tested that responded to noxious stimuli could be activated antidromically by stimulation of the surface of SI sensory cortex. It was possible to confirm that many of these cells project to the SI sensory cortex by using microstimulation. Successful microstimulation points were either within the SI cortex or in the white matter just beneath the cortex. 8. We conclude that some neurons in the VPLc nucleus are capable of signaling noiceptive stimuli. The nociceptive information appears to reach these cells through the ventral part of the lateral funiculus on the side contralateral to the receptive field, presumably by way of the spinothalamic tract. The VPLc cells are somatotopically organized, and they are thalamocortical neurons that project to the VPLc nucleus and SI cortex play a role in nociception.},

abstract = {A century after Cajal identified a "third element" of the nervous system, many issues have been clarified about the identity and function of one of its major components, the microglia. Here, we review recent findings by microgliologists, highlighting results from imaging studies that are helping provide new views of microglial behavior and function. In vivo imaging in the intact adult rodent CNS has revolutionized our understanding of microglial behaviors in situ and has raised speculation about their function in the uninjured adult brain. Imaging studies in ex vivo mammalian tissue preparations and in intact model organisms including zebrafish are providing insights into microglial behaviors during brain development. These data suggest that microglia play important developmental roles in synapse remodeling, developmental apoptosis, phagocytic clearance, and angiogenesis. Because microglia also contribute to pathology, including neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders, ischemic injury, and neuropathic pain, promising new results raise the possibility of leveraging microglia for therapeutic roles. Finally, exciting recent work is addressing unanswered questions regarding the nature of microglial-neuronal communication. While it is now apparent that microglia play diverse roles in neural development, behavior, and pathology, future research using neuroimaging techniques will be essential to more fully exploit these intriguing cellular targets for effective therapeutic intervention applied to a variety of conditions.},

abstract = {Attention is a key concept in many theories of pain perception. A clinically popular idea is that pain is more intense in persons who are hypervigilant for or bias their attention to pain information. So far, evidence for such bias in pain patients as compared to healthy persons is inconclusive. Furthermore, studies investigating the effects of distracting attention away from pain have shown contradictory results. In this review, we present a motivational perspective on attentional processing of pain that accounts for these inconclusive research findings. We argue that pain always has to be considered within a context of goal pursuit. From this perspective, two largely unexplored theoretical assumptions are introduced. First, when pain occurs during the pursuit of a certain goal, it may unintentionally capture attention although it is not relevant for the goal. Whether such unintentional attentional capture happens is not only dependent upon the characteristics of the pain but also on the characteristics of the focal goal. Second, attention to pain and pain-related information might be driven by a focal goal related to pain. Attentional processing of pain information will be particularly enhanced when the focal goal is related to pain management (e.g., attempting to gain control). Future research should systematically investigate the role of motivation and goal pursuit in the attentional processing of pain-related information. This motivational perspective offers a powerful framework to explain inter- and intra-individual differences in the deployment of attention to pain-related information. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The cerebral venous outflow consists of the superficial system and the deep draining system. The deep one drains the areas of the great vein of Galen, the two basal veins of Rosenthal, and their tributaries. Simultaneous obstruction of these veins can effect great harm. In the case of obstruction of the vein of Galen, the basal vein can ensure the venous outflow. Therefore, attention should be paid to anastomoses between the basal vein and the infratentorial venous system. The lateral mesencephalic vein (LMV) is the most important anastomosis between the supra- and infratentorial system linking the basal vein to the superior petrosal sinus. Since microanatomical studies concerning this vein have received less attention the aim of the present study was to visualize the course of this vein, its junction with the basal vein, its tributaries and its relationship with neural structures. Fifty-two cadaveric hemispheres were examined under the operating microscope. The LMV could be identified in all cases, with a mean diameter of 1.07 mm. Thorough understanding of the microanatomy of the LMV is crucial to avoid brain damage due to venous infarction during surgery, and its preservation could ensure deep venous outflow in the case of obstruction of the vein of Galen},

abstract = {The structural and functional data gathered with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques about the brain cortical motor damage in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are controversial. In fact some structural MRI studies showed foci of gray matter (GM) atrophy in the precentral gyrus, even in the early stage, while others did not. Most functional MRI (fMRI) studies in ALS reported hyperactivation of extra-primary motor cortices, while contradictory results were obtained on the activation of the primary motor cortex. We aimed to investigate the cortical motor circuitries in ALS patients by a combined structural and functional approach.Twenty patients with definite ALS and 16 healthy subjects underwent a structural examination with acquisition of a 3D T1-weighted sequence and fMRI examination during a maximal force handgrip task executed with the right-hand, the left-hand and with both hands simultaneously. The T1-weighted images were analyzed with Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) that showed several clusters of reduced cortical GM in ALS patients compared to controls including the pre and postcentral gyri, the superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri, the supplementary motor area, the superior and inferior parietal cortices and the temporal lobe, bilaterally but more extensive on the right side. In ALS patients a significant hypoactivation of the primary sensory motor cortex and frontal dorsal premotor areas as compared to controls was observed. The hypoactivated areas matched with foci of cortical atrophy demonstrated by VBM. The fMRI analysis also showed an enhanced activation in the ventral premotor frontal areas and in the parietal cortex pertaining to the fronto-parietal motor circuit which paralleled with disease progression rate and matched with cortical regions of atrophy. The hyperactivation of the fronto-parietal circuit was asymmetric and prevalent in the left hemisphere.VBM and fMRI identified structural and functional markers of an extended cortical damage within the motor circuit of ALS patients. The functional changes in non-primary motor cortices pertaining to fronto-parietal circuit suggest an over-recruitment of a pre-existing physiological sensory-motor network. However, the concomitant fronto-parietal cortical atrophy arises the possibility that such a hyper-activation reflects cortical hyper-excitability due to loss of inhibitory inter-neurons. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Acute experimental brush-evoked allodynia induces a cortical activation pattern that differs from that typically seen during experimental nociceptive pain. In this study, we used positron emission tomography to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with clinical allodynia. Nine patients with peripheral nerve injury were scanned during rest, brush-evoked allodynia, and brushing of normal contralateral skin. PET data were analyzed for the whole group and for single subjects. Allodynic stimulation activated the contralateral orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11) in every patient. Whereas normal brushing activated most strongly the contralateral insular cortex, allodynic brushing produced an ipsilateral activation in this area. Another important difference between normal and allodynic brushing was the absence of a contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) activation during allodynic brushing. No thalamic activation was observed during allodynic or control brushing. Although no anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation could be demonstrated in the group analysis, single subject analysis revealed that four patients activated this region during brush-evoked allodynia. A direct post hoc comparison of brush -and allodynia-induced rCBF changes showed that allodynia was associated with significantly stronger activations in orbitofrontal cortex and ipsilateral insula whereas non-painful brushing more strongly activated SI and BA 5/7. These findings indicate that activity in the cortical network involved in the sensory-discriminative processing of nociceptive pain is downregulated in neuropathic pain. Instead, there is an upregulation of activity in the orbitofrontal and insular cortices, which is probably due to the stronger emotional load of neuropathic pain and higher computational demands of processing a mixed sensation of brush and pain.},

abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has become an established research tool for the investigation of tissue structure and orientation. In this paper, we present a method for real-time processing of diffusion tensor and Q-ball imaging. The basic idea is to use Kalman filtering framework to fit either the linear tensor or Q-ball model. Because the Kalman filter is designed to be an incremental algorithm, it naturally enables updating the model estimate after the acquisition of any new diffusion-weighted volume. Processing diffusion models and maps during ongoing scans provides a new useful tool for clinicians, especially when it is not possible to predict how long a subject may remain still in the magnet. First, we introduce the general linear models corresponding to the two diffusion tensor and analytical Q-ball models of interest. Then, we present the Kalman filtering framework and we focus on the optimization of the diffusion orientation sets in order to speed up the convergence of the online processing. Last, we give some results on a healthy volunteer for the online tensor and the Q-ball model, and we make some comparisons with the conventional offline techniques used in the literature. We could achieve full real-time for diffusion tensor imaging and deferred time for Q-ball imaging, using a single workstation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To preoperatively detect, by using diffusion-tensor imaging coregistered with anatomic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, suspected microstructural tissue changes of the trigeminal nerves in patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) resulting from neurovascular compression. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Twenty patients (mean age, 51.3 years) with TN and evidence of neurovascular contact were examined with use of a 3.0-T MR unit combined with an eight-channel head coil before undergoing surgical decompression. A single-shot diffusion-tensor echo-planar sequence was used along 15 different diffusion directions, with a b value of 1000 sec/mm(2) and a section thickness of 2 mm. For anatomic correlation, 0.6-mm isotropic three-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state images were acquired for coregistration with the functional diffusion-tensor maps. After region of interest placement, mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for each nerve by using the paired-sample two-tailed t test (with P {\textless} .005 indicating significance) and compared with surgical findings. RESULTS FA was significantly lower (P = .004) on the trigeminal neuralgia-affected side (mean FA, 0.203) than on the contralateral side (mean FA, 0.239). ADCs were nearly identical between the normal and TN-affected nerve tissues. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that diffusion-tensor imaging enables the identification and quantification of anisotropic changes between normal nerve tissue and TN-affected trigeminal nerves. Coregistration of anatomic three-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state imaging and diffusion-tensor imaging facilitates excellent delineation of the cisternal segments of the trigeminal nerves.},

In the literature, two levels of statistical analysis have been considered in comparing brain connectivity across groups and subjects: 1) the global comparison where a single measure that summarizes the information of each brain is used in a statistical test; 2) the local analysis where a single test is performed either for each node/connection which implies a multiplicity correction, or for each group of nodes/connections where each subset is summarized by one single test in order to reduce the number of tests to avoid a penalizing multiplicity correction. We comment on the different levels of analysis and present some methods that have been proposed at each scale.

To this end, we have developed a suite of image-processing tools for fiber tractography with improved reliability. This article summarizes the main technical developments we have made to date, which include anisotropic smoothing, anisotropic interpolation, Bayesian fiber tracking and automatic fiber bundling. A primary focus of these techniques is the robustness to noise and partial volume averaging, the two major hurdles to reliable fiber tractography. Performance of these techniques has been comprehensively examined with simulated and in vivo DTI data, demonstrating improvements in the robustness and reliability of DTI tractography.},

abstract = {Cross-sectional studies of normal aging indicate an association between memory and hippocampal volume, and between executive functioning and subcortical-frontal circuits. Much less is known, however, about the relationship between longitudinal MRI changes and cognitive decline. The authors hypothesized that longitudinal change in memory would be best predicted by change in hippocampal volumes, whereas change in executive functioning would be best predicted by cortical atrophy and progression of MRI markers of cerebrovascular disease. For this study, 50 healthy elderly subjects underwent structural MRI and cognitive testing at baseline and again at follow-up, with a mean follow-up interval of 45 months. Volumetric MRI measures were hippocampus, cortical gray matter, white matter signal hyperintensity (WMSH), and lacunae. Neuropsychological measures were psychometrically robust composite scores of episodic memory (MEM) and executive functioning (EXEC). Hierarchical multiple regression indicated that a decrease in hippocampus was associated with a decline in MEM, whereas decreased cortical gray matter and increased WMSH were independently associated with a decline in EXEC. Results suggest that in normal aging, cognitive functioning declines as cortical gray matter and hippocampus decrease, and WMSH increases. The association between WMSH and EXEC further highlights the cognitive sequealae associated with cerebrovascular disease in normal elderly.},

abstract = {Noxious stimuli usually cause pain and pain usually arises from noxious stimuli, but exceptions to these apparent truisms are the basis for clinically important problems and provide valuable insight into the neural code for pain. In this Review, we discuss how painful sensations arise. We argue that, although primary somatosensory afferents are tuned to specific stimulus features, natural stimuli often activate more than one type of afferent. Manipulating coactivation patterns can alter perception in ways that argue against each type of afferent acting independently (as expected for strictly labeled lines), suggesting instead that signals conveyed by different types of afferents interact. Deciphering the central circuits that mediate those interactions is critical for explaining the generation and modulation of neural signals that ultimately elicit pain. The advent of genetic and optical dissection techniques promise to dramatically accelerate progress toward this goal, which will facilitate the rational design of future pain therapeutics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gamma knife thalamotomy (GKT) has been used as a therapeutic option for patients with disabling tremor refractory to medications. Impressive improvement of tremor has been reported in the neurosurgical literature, but the reliability of such data has been questioned. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate clinical outcomes after GKT for disabling tremor with blinded assessments. DESIGN: Prospective study with blinded independent neurologic evaluations. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients who underwent unilateral GKT for essential tremor and Parkinson disease tremor at our center. These patients were unwilling or deemed unsuitable candidates for deep brain stimulation or other surgical procedures. INTERVENTIONS: Unilateral GKT and regular follow-up evaluations for up to 30 months, with blinded video evaluations by a movement disorders neurologist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes, as measured by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale and activities of daily living scores, and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: From September 1, 2006, to November 30, 2008, 18 patients underwent unilateral GKT for essential tremor and Parkinson disease tremor at our center. Videos for 14 patients (11 with essential tremor, 3 with Parkinson disease tremor) with at least 6 months' postoperative follow-up were available for analysis (mean SD follow-up duration, 19.2 7.3 months; range, 7-30 months). The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale activities of daily living scores improved significantly after GKT (P = .03; median and mean change scores, 2.5 and 2.7 points, respectively range of scale was 0-27), but there was no significant improvement in other Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale items (P = .53 for resting tremor, P = .24 for postural tremor, P = .62 for action tremor, P = .40 for drawing, P {\textgreater} .99 for pouring water, P = .89 for head tremor). Handwriting and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale activities of daily living scores tended to improve (P = .07 and .11, respectively). Three patients developed delayed neurologic adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that GKT provided only modest antitremor efficacy. Of the 2 patients with essential tremor who experienced marked improvement in tremor, 1 subsequently experienced a serious adverse event. Further prospective studies with careful neurologic evaluation of outcomes are necessary before GKT can be recommended for disabling tremor on a routine clinical basis.},

abstract = {We propose an integral concept for tractography to describe crossing and splitting fibre bundles based on the fibre orientation distribution function (ODF) estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We show that in order to perform accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT provides new insight into the relationship between the HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical spherical deconvolution and improves the angular resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of this paper is the development of new deterministic and new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the full multidirectional information obtained through use of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is performed on human brain datasets comparing our new deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an application of our new probabilistic tracking, we quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects. Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to incorrect interpretations of brain functions.},

abstract = {A review of over 2,000 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and related disorders in the literature and our own files yielded 231 cases of dementia with early lower motor neuron signs. The clinical-pathological profiles of the 231 cases were distinctly different from those of cases of transmissible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: the patients had a longer illness, and their brains lacked the typical spongiform change. Brain tissue from 33 of these patients has been inoculated intracerebrally into nonhuman primates, but only 2 atypical cases transmitted a spongiform encephalopathy; 23 have been incubating from three to twelve years and can be considered negative transmission experiments. The findings suggest that most cases of dementia associated with early amyotrophy are more closely related to classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis than to transmissible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and do not deserve the label of "amyotrophic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease." When lower motor neuron involvement occurs in transmissible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it is usually late and accompanied by signs of a more fulminant cerebral and cerebellar involvement.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with brain volume loss, but there is little information on the regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) changes that contribute to overall loss. Since axonal injury is a common occurrence in TBI, imaging methods that are sensitive to WM damage such as diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) may be useful for characterizing microstructural brain injury contributing to regional WM loss in TBI. High-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DTI were used to evaluate regional changes in TBI patients compared to matched controls. Patients received neuropsychological testing and were imaged approximately 2 months and 12.7 months post-injury. Paradoxically, neuropsychological function improved from Visit 1 to Visit 2, while voxel-based analyses of fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) from the DTI images, and voxel-based analyses of the GM and WM probability maps from the T1-weighted images, mainly revealed significantly greater deleterious GM and WM change over time in patients compared to controls. Cross-sectional comparisons of the DTI measures indicated that patients have decreased FA and increased MD compared to controls over large regions of the brain. TBI affected virtually all of the major fiber bundles in the brain including the corpus callosum, cingulum, the superior and inferior longitudinal fascicules, the uncinate fasciculus, and brain stem fiber tracts. The results indicate that both GM and WM degeneration are significant contributors to brain volume loss in the months following brain injury, and also suggest that DTI measures may be more useful than high-resolution anatomical images in assessment of group differences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with atypical neuralgia or atypical facial pain have been surgically treated with microvascular decompression (MVD) of the trigeminal root entry zone (TREZ). There are no data regarding the sensitivity and specificity of a vessel-TREZ relationship as a cause of pain in patients with persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) according to the definition given by the International Headache Society (IHS). METHODS: The TREZ was visualised by 3D CISS MRI in 12 patients with unilateral PIFP according to the IHS criteria. RESULTS: The frequency of artery-TREZ, vein-TREZ, or vessel (artery/vein)-TREZ contacts on the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides did not differ significantly. On the symptomatic side, vessel-TREZ contact was found in 58{\%} of patients (sensitivity). On the asymptomatic side, vessel-TREZ contact was absent in 33{\%} of patients (specificity). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the low sensitivity and specificity found in the present study, PIFP cannot be attributed to a vessel-TREZ contact, and therefore, pain relief after MVD cannot be expected},

We combine the advantages of edge bundles with a bundle-centric simplified visual representation of a graph's struc- ture. For this, we first compute a hierarchical edge clustering of a given graph layout which groups similar edges together. Next, we render clusters at a user-selected level of detail using a new image-based technique that com- bines distance-based splatting and shape skeletonization. The overall result displays a given graph as a small set of overlapping shaded edge bundles. Luminance, saturation, hue, and shading encode edge density, edge types, and edge similarity. Finally, we add brushing and a new type of semantic lens to help navigation where local structures overlap. We illustrate the proposed method on several real-world graph datasets.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore the occurrence and the risk factors of back-related loss of working time in patients undergoing surgery for lumbar disc herniation. One hundred and fifty-two gainfully employed patients underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation. Two months postoperatively, those patients completed a self-report questionnaire including queries on back and leg pain (VAS), functional capacity (Oswestry disability index--ODI, version 1.0), and motivation to work. After 5 years, lost working time was evaluated by means of a postal questionnaire about sick leave and disability pensions. The cumulative number of back pain-related days-off work was calculated for each patient. All 152 patients, 86 men and 66 women, were prescribed sick leave for the first 2 months. Thereafter, 80 (53{\%}) of them reported back pain-related sick leave or early retirement. A permanent work disability pension due to back problems was awarded to 15 (10{\%}) patients, 5 men (6{\%}) and 10 women (15{\%}). Median number of all work disability days per year was 11 (interquartile range [IQR] 9-37); it was 9 days (IQR 9-22) in patients with minimal disability (ODI score 0-20) at 2 months postoperatively and 67 days (IQR 9-352) in those with moderate or severe disability (ODI {\textgreater} 20; P {\textless} 0.001). The respective means were 61, 29, and 140 days/year. Multivariate analysis showed ODI {\textgreater} 20, leg pain, and poor motivation to work to be the risk factors for extension of work disability. Results of the present study show that after the lumbar disc surgery, poor outcome in questionnaire measures the physical functioning (ODI) and leg pain at 2 months postoperatively, as well as poor motivation to work, are associated with the loss of working time. Patients with unfavourable prognosis should be directed to rehabilitation before the loss of employment},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Several groups suggested that the gradient table of a DTI data set should be reoriented to compensate for head motion. Although the effects of this correction were demonstrated qualitatively, its efficacy was not demonstrated quantitatively to date. The main goal of this study was to investigate the efficacy of gradient table correction on improving the accuracy of fiber tractography.

METHODS: First, the effects of gradient table correction on the estimation of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps and the primary diffusion direction were quantified and compared with the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process. Then, the effects of gradient table correction on tractography were quantified.

RESULTS: The corrections in FA values were only a fraction of the typical values seen in major fasciculi and inter-subject variance. The corrections to the primary diffusion direction were also much smaller than the uncertainty inherent in the estimation of its direction. However, the directional estimates were biased due to head motion and deviated fiber tracking.

CONCLUSIONS: Corrections to FA values were negligible and are not expected to affect group comparisons. However, a small but consistent bias was introduced to the estimates of primary diffusion direction, which might affect brain connectivity analyses based on fiber tracking.

abstract = {Development of treatments for acute and chronic pain conditions remains a challenge, with an unmet need for improved sensitivity and reproducibility in measuring pain in patients. Here we used pulsed-continuous arterial spin-labelling [pCASL], a relatively novel perfusion magnetic-resonance imaging technique, in conjunction with a commonly-used post-surgical model, to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow [rCBF] associated with the experience of being in ongoing pain. We demonstrate repeatable, reproducible assessment of ongoing pain that is independent of patient self-report. In a cross-over trial design, 16 participants requiring bilateral removal of lower-jaw third molars underwent pain-free pre-surgical pCASL scans. Following extraction of either left or right tooth, repeat scans were acquired during post-operative ongoing pain. When pain-free following surgical recovery, the pre/post-surgical scanning procedure was repeated for the remaining tooth. Voxelwise statistical comparison of pre and post-surgical scans was performed to reveal rCBF changes representing ongoing pain. In addition, rCBF values in predefined pain and control brain regions were obtained. rCBF increases (5-10{\%}) representing post-surgical ongoing pain were identified bilaterally in a network including primary and secondary somatosensory, insula and cingulate cortices, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain and brainstem (including trigeminal ganglion and principal-sensory nucleus), but not in a control region in visual cortex. rCBF changes were reproducible, with no rCBF differences identified across scans within-session or between post-surgical pain sessions. This is the first report of the cerebral representation of ongoing post-surgical pain without the need for exogenous tracers. Regions of rCBF increases are plausibly associated with pain and the technique is reproducible, providing an attractive proposition for testing interventions for on-going pain that do not rely solely on patient self-report. Our findings have the potential to improve our understanding of the cerebral representation of persistent painful conditions, leading to improved identification of specific patient sub-types and implementation of mechanism-based treatments.},

abstract = {The optimum sequence parameters of diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) on clinical scanners were investigated previously. However, the scan time of approximately 30 min is still too long for patient studies. Additionally, relatively large sampling interval in the diffusion-encoding space may cause aliasing artifact in the probability density function when Fourier transform is undertaken, leading to estimation error in fiber orientations. Therefore, this study proposed a non-Cartesian sampling scheme, body-centered-cubic (BCC), to avoid the aliasing artifact as compared to the conventional Cartesian grid sampling scheme (GRID). Furthermore, the accuracy of DSI with the use of half-sphere sampling schemes, i.e. GRID102 and BCC91, was investigated by comparing to their full-sphere sampling schemes, GRID203 and BCC181, respectively. In results, smaller deviation angle and lower angular dispersion were obtained by using the BCC sampling scheme. The half-sphere sampling schemes yielded angular precision and accuracy comparable to the full-sphere sampling schemes. The optimum b(max) was approximately 4750 s/mm(2) for GRID and 4500 s/mm(2) for BCC. In conclusion, the BCC sampling scheme could be implemented as a useful alternative to the GRID sampling scheme. Combination of BCC and half-sphere sampling schemes, that is BCC91, may potentially reduce the scan time of DSI from 30 min to approximately 14 min while maintaining its precision and accuracy.},

The average of the second and third eigenvalues is the radial diffusivity, d(rad) v₁ may be affected by pathology, therefore when comparing d(ax) and d(rad) in patients one has to consider the direction of the measurement and underlying anatomy. Here we created a representative super-DT dataset, DT(ref), whose eigenvector, v(1,ref), was considered the most likely direction of diffusivity per voxel. We defined the projected axial diffusivity, d(p-ax), as the projection of individual DTs along v(1,ref) and the projected radial diffusivity, d(p-rad), as the average of the projections along the second and third eigenvectors of DT(ref). The projected diffusivities are promising new parameters for studying white matter pathology.},

abstract = {There are 2 principal techniques of functional MRI (fMRI): the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) technique, which is the favoured method because no intravenous contrast medium is required, and the dynamic or exogenous technique. The BOLD technique takes advantage of the fact that the change from diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin to paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin that takes place with brain activation results in decreased signal intensity on MRI. Commercially available scanners can be used to conduct single-slice BOLD fMRI experiments, but echo-planar hardware is needed for multislice wholebrain experiments. Sequence choices in BOLD fMRI include spin-echo and gradient-echo sequences, to which rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement and echoplanar techniques may be applied. Optimal imaging parameters (echo time, slice thickness, field of view and flip angle) are important in maximizing signal-to-noise ratios. Various statistical techniques and software programs have been developed to interpret the large amounts of data gathered from BOLD fMRI experiments, which presents one of the biggest challenges in performing this technique with clinical MR units. Controversy exists regarding the effects of draining veins on cortical mapping, of inflow of blood into the imaging slice or volume, and of motion artifact. BOLD fMRI has demonstrated good correlation with positron emission tomography, magneto-encephalography and electrocorticographic recordings of motor responses. It has been used to study cortical activity of visual, motor, auditory and speech tasks as well as brain centres for smell, motor imagery, complex motion and memory. As such, it holds promise for the study of brain function, but must be subjected to larger studies comparing it with the gold standard of electrocorticographic mapping.},

Treatment of pain-related suffering requires knowledge of how pain signals are initially interpreted and subsequently transmitted and perpetuated. This review article is one of three reviews in this issue of Neuron that address our understanding of the pain process and possible solutions to the problem from both cellular- and systems-level viewpoints. In order to deal effectively with danger, it is imperative to know about it. This is what nociceptors do-these primary sensory neurons are specialized to detect intense stimuli and represent, therefore, the first line of defense against any potentially threatening or damaging environmental inputs. By sensing noxious stimuli and contributing to the necessary reactions to avoid them-rapid withdrawal and the experience of an intensely unpleasant or painful sensation, nociceptors are essential for the maintenance of the body's integrity. Although nociceptive pain is clearly an adaptive alarm system, persistent pain is maladaptive, essentially an ongoing false alarm. Here, we highlight the genesis of nociceptors during development and the intrinsic properties of nociceptors that enable them to transduce, conduct, and transmit nociceptive information and also discuss how their phenotypic plasticity contributes to clinical pain. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Wilson2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies intending to measure drug-induced changes in learning and memory are challenged to parse out the effects of drugs on sensory, motor, and associative systems in the brain. In the context of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), drugs that alter the sensorium of subjects and affect their ability to taste and/or feel malaise may limit the ability of investigators to make conclusions about associative effects of these substances. Since the GABAergic system is implicated in inhibition, the authors were hopeful to use the GABA agonist, baclofen (BAC), to enhance extinction of a CTA, but first a preliminary evaluation of BAC's peripheral effects on animals' sensorium had to be completed due to a lack of published literature in this area.

FINDINGS: Our first experiment aimed to evaluate the extent to which the GABAB agonist, BAC, altered the ability of rats to differentiate between 0.3{\%} and 0.6{\%} saccharin (SAC) in a two bottle preference test. Here we report that 2 or 3 mg/kg (i.p.) BAC, but not 1 mg/kg BAC, impaired animals' gustatory discrimination abilities in this task. Furthermore, when SAC consumption was preceded by 2 or 3 mg/kg (i.p.) BAC, rats depressed their subsequent SAC drinking.A second experiment evaluated if the suppression of SAC and water drinking (revealed in Experiment 1) was mediated by amnesiac effects of BAC or whether BAC possessed US properties in the context of the CTA paradigm. The time necessary to reach an asymptotic level of CTA extinction was not significantly different in those animals that received the 3 mg/kg dose of BAC compared to more conventionally SAC + lithium chloride (LiCl, 81 mg/kg) conditioned animals.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were not consistent with a simple amnesia-of-neophobia explanation. Instead, results indicated that 2 and 3 mg/kg (i.p.) BAC were capable of inducing a CTA, which was extinguishable via repeated presentations of SAC only. Our data indicate that, depending on the dose, BAC can alter SAC taste discrimination and act as a potent US in the context of a CTA paradigm.},

abstract = {Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded in 13 patients from pairs of microelectrodes driven through thalamus during functional localization prior to implantation of a thalamic deep brain stimulation electrode for treatment of tremor or pain. Six patients had a history of essential tremor (ET), 3 of multiple sclerosis, and the remaining 4 had symptoms of chronic pain. Specific to the ET group was the observation that oscillatory field potentials recorded from the two microelectrodes in the motor thalamus (ventralis intermedius-Vim, ventralis oralis posterior-Vop) were highly coherent at frequencies characteristic of pathological tremor (4-7 Hz). This stands in contrast to the significantly more desynchronized state observed in the somatosensory thalamus (ventralis caudalis-Vc) for that frequency band. In addition, higher frequency coherent oscillations typically associated with physiological tremor (8-12 Hz) were observed in the ET patients in motor thalamus and Vc and in motor thalamus of pain patients. An examination of the inter-frequency correlation of the LFPs in Vim and Vop showed that the low frequency theta waves correlated with high frequency oscillations in the beta and gamma ranges. These findings are consistent with and extend those of other studies suggesting that alterations in thalamic oscillatory activity are involved in the pathophysiology of ET and furthermore suggest that increased synchronization in the 4-7 Hz range is related to the occurrence of tremor in the ET patient group. Furthermore, they support the idea that therapies such as lesions and high frequency stimulation of the motor thalamus are effective in reducing tremor symptoms since they destroy the abnormal low frequency synchronization in motor thalamus.},

abstract = {It has long been recognized that the diffusion tensor model is inappropriate to characterize complex fiber architecture, causing tensor-derived measures such as the primary eigenvector and fractional anisotropy to be unreliable or misleading in these regions. There is however still debate about the impact of this problem in practice. A recent study using a Bayesian automatic relevance detection (ARD) multicompartment model suggested that a third of white matter (WM) voxels contain crossing fibers, a value that, whilst already significant, is likely to be an underestimate. The aim of this study is to provide more robust estimates of the proportion of affected voxels, the number of fiber orientations within each WM voxel, and the impact on tensor-derived analyses, using large, high-quality diffusion-weighted data sets, with reconstruction parameters optimized specifically for this task. Two reconstruction algorithms were used: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and the ARD method used in the previous study. We estimate the proportion of WM voxels containing crossing fibers to be ∼90{\%} (using CSD) and 63{\%} (using ARD). Both these values are much higher than previously reported, strongly suggesting that the diffusion tensor model is inadequate in the vast majority of WM regions. This has serious implications for downstream processing applications that depend on this model, particularly tractography, and the interpretation of anisotropy and radial/axial diffusivity measures.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The underlying changes in the neuronal connectivity adjacent to brain tumors cannot always be depicted by conventional MR imaging. The hypothesis of this study was that preoperative sensorimotor deficits are associated with impairment in pyramidal fiber bundles. Hence, we investigated the potential of combined quantitative diffusion tensor (DT) fiber tracking and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to determine changes in the pyramidal tract adjacent to gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative DT fiber tracking and proton MRSI were performed in 20 patients with gliomas with WHO grades II-IV. Eight patients experienced preoperative sensorimotor deficits. Mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and number of fibers per voxel (FpV) were calculated for the pyramidal tract of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere. Metabolite concentrations for choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were computed, using LCModel, for all voxels located at the pyramidal tracts. RESULTS: For the whole pyramidal tract, quantitative DT fiber tracking resulted in significantly lower FpV and FA values (P {\textless} .001), but not MD values, for the ipsilateral hemisphere. For the section of the fiber bundle closest to the lesion, we found significantly decreased FpV and FA (P {\textless} .001) and increased MD (P = .002). MRSI showed, for the same volumes of interest, significantly decreased NAA (P = .001), increased Cho (P = .034) and Cho/NAA (P = .001) for the ipsilateral pyramidal tract. In patients suffering sensorimotor deficits, we found significantly lower FA (P = .022) and higher MD values (P = .026) and a strongly negative correlation between FA and MD (R = -0.710, P = .024) but no correlation in patients without deficits (R = 0.078, ns). CONCLUSION: Quantitative DTI was able to show significant differences in diffusivity of the pyramidal tract in patients with sensorimotor deficits in relation to patients without them. The additional use of proton MRSI may be helpful to discern whether these diffusivity changes in fiber tracts are caused by tumor infiltration or peritumoral edema},

abstract = {We studied six patients in whom colloid cysts had been removed surgically from the third ventricle. The patients were selected simply by availability for the study, not on grounds of clinically diagnosed amnesia or its absence. The outcomes of operation ranged from one patient who had postoperatively resumed a normal life without complaint of memory disorder at any stage, through four who complained of memory disorder since operation, to one who was so severely amnesic as to require constant supervision. Each patient was given psychometric tests of memory, and was also scanned by magnetic-resonance imaging. One of us examined the six scans and assessed the extent of damage to the fornix, and any other brain damage, in ignorance of the outcomes of the psychometric tests. The fornix in the right hemisphere had been destroyed in all six cases, and all showed evidence of moderate or severe impairment in nonverbal memory. The fornix in the left hemisphere was intact in only one patient; this was the patient who had resumed a normal life without complaint of memory disorder. The left fornix was damaged with some sparing in one further patient, and the remaining four patients showed destruction of the fornix in the left as well as in the right hemisphere. The severity of impairment in verbal memory in these six cases was related to the severity of the damage to the left fornix. No other evidence of brain damage appeared to be systematically related to memory ability. These results add to the evidence that bilateral fornix damage produces amnesia, and that sparing of the left fornix alone is sufficient to ensure a more favourable outcome.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) enable innovative applications of machine learning like image recognition, machine translation, or malware detection. However, deep learning is often criticized for its lack of robustness in adversarial settings (e.g., vulnerability to adversarial inputs) and general inability to rationalize its predictions. In this work, we exploit the structure of deep learning to enable new learning-based inference and decision strategies that achieve desirable properties such as robustness and interpretability. We take a first step in this direction and introduce the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN). This hybrid classifier combines the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with representations of the data learned by each layer of the DNN: a test input is compared to its neighboring training points according to the distance that separates them in the representations. We show the labels of these neighboring points afford confidence estimates for inputs outside the model's training manifold, including on malicious inputs like adversarial examples--and therein provides protections against inputs that are outside the models understanding. This is because the nearest neighbors can be used to estimate the nonconformity of, i.e., the lack of support for, a prediction in the training data. The neighbors also constitute human-interpretable explanations of predictions. We evaluate the DkNN algorithm on several datasets, and show the confidence estimates accurately identify inputs outside the model, and that the explanations provided by nearest neighbors are intuitive and useful in understanding model failures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: White matter fiber tracts, especially those interconnecting the frontal and temporal lobes, are likely implicated in pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Very few studies, however, have focused on the fornix, a compact bundle of white matter fibers, projecting from the hippocampus to the septum, anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the mamillary bodies. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and a new post-processing method, fiber tractography, provides a unique opportunity to visualize and to quantify entire trajectories of fiber bundles, such as the fornix, in vivo. We applied these techniques to quantify fornix diffusion anisotropy in schizophrenia. METHODS: DTI images were used to evaluate the left and the right fornix in 36 male patients diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia and 35 male healthy individuals, group matched on age, parental socioeconomic status, and handedness. Regions of interest were drawn manually, blind to group membership, to guide tractography, and fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of fiber integrity, was calculated and averaged over the entire tract for each subject. The Doors and People test (DPT) was used to evaluate visual and verbal memory, combined recall and combined recognition. RESULTS: Analysis of variance was performed and findings demonstrated a difference between patients with schizophrenia and controls for fornix FA (p=0.006). Protected post-hoc independent sample t-tests demonstrated a bilateral FA decrease in schizophrenia, compared with control subjects (left side: p=0.048; right side p=0.006). Higher fornix FA was statistically significantly correlated with DPT and measures of combined visual memory (r=0.554, p=0.026), combined verbal memory (r=0.647, p=0.007), combined recall (r=0.516, p=0.041), and combined recognition (r=0.710, p=0.002) for the control group. No such statistically significant correlations were found in the patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the utility of applying DTI and tractography to study white matter fiber tracts in vivo in schizophrenia. Specifically, we observed a bilateral disruption in fornix integrity in schizophrenia, thus broadening our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease.},

The connectivity is presented for a representative selection of regions in the brain in matrices and connectograms.

The periinsular sulci and the central (insular and cerebral) sulci were the first macroscopical structures identified on the lateral surface of the human fetal cerebral hemisphere with earlier development on the right hemisphere. Here we describe five stages of insular gyral and sulcal development closely related to gestational age: stage 1: appearance of the first sulcus at 13-17 GWs, stage 2: development of the periinsular sulci at 18-19 GWs, stage 3: central sulci and opercularization of the insula at 20-22 GWs, stage 4: covering of the posterior insula at 24-26 GWs, stage 5: closure of the sylvian fissure at 27-28 GWs. We provide evidence that cortical maturation (sulcation and gyration) and vascularization of the lateral surface of the brain starts with the insular region, suggesting that this region is a central area of cortical development.},

abstract = {While hippocampal atrophy has been described during healthy aging, few studies have examined its relationship with the integrity of White Matter (WM) connecting tracts of the limbic system. This investigation examined WM structural damage specifically related to hippocampal atrophy in healthy aging subjects (n = 129), using morphological MRI to assess hippocampal volume and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to assess WM integrity. Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia were excluded from the analysis. In our sample, increasing age was significantly associated with reduced hippocampal volume and reduced Fractional Anisotropy (FA) at the level of the fornix and the cingulum bundle. The findings also demonstrate that hippocampal atrophy was specifically associated with reduced FA of the fornix bundle, but it was not related to alteration of the cingulum bundle. Our results indicate that the relationship between hippocampal atrophy and fornix FA values is not due to an independent effect of age on both structures. A recursive regression procedure was applied to evaluate sequential relationships between the alterations of these two brain structures. When both hippocampal atrophy and fornix FA values were included in the same model to predict age, fornix FA values remained significant whereas hippocampal atrophy was no longer significantly associated with age. According to this latter finding, hippocampal atrophy in healthy aging could be mediated by a loss of fornix connections. Structural alterations of this part of the limbic system, which have been associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, result at least in part from the aging process.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging is often performed by acquiring a series of diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar images with different direction diffusion gradients. A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas.

abstract = {Clinical outcome assessment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is challenging due to the diversity and fluctuating nature of MS symptoms. Traditional clinical scales such as the EDSS are inadequate in their assessment of key clinical dimensions of MS (e.g. , cognitive function), and they have psychometric limitations as well. Based on analyses of pooled data from natural history studies and from placebo groups in clinical trials, the National MS Society's Clinical Outcomes Assessment Task Force recently proposed a new multidimensional clinical outcome measure, the MS Functional Composite (MSFC). The MSFC comprises quantitative functional measures of three key clinical dimensions of MS: leg function/ambulation, arm/hand function, and cognitive function. Scores on component measures are converted to standard scores (z-scores), which are averaged to form a single MSFC score. Preliminary analyses confirm that: (1) the three clinical dimensions of the MSFC are relatively independent; (2) the MSFC is sensitive to clinical changes over 1- and 2-year intervals; and (3) the MSFC has acceptable criterion validity (i.e., predicts both concurrent and subsequent EDSS change). The advantages and potential limitations of incorporating quantitative functional outcome measures such as the MSFC into collaborative databases are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent investigations indicate a site of cardiac representation within the left insular cortex of the rat. Moreover, the results of lesion studies suggest left-sided insular dominance for sympathetic cardiovascular effects. It is unclear whether similar representation exists within the human insular cortex. Five epileptic patients underwent intraoperative insular stimulation prior to temporal lobectomy for seizure control. On stimulation of the left insular cortex, bradycardia and depressor responses were more frequently produced than tachycardia and pressor effects (p less than 0.005). The converse applied for the right insular cortex. We believe this to be the first demonstration of cardiovascular changes elicitable during insular stimulation in humans, and of lateralization of such responses for a cortical site. In humans, unlike the rat, there appears to be right-sided dominance for sympathetic effects. These findings may be of relevance in predicting the autonomic effects of stroke in humans and in the explanation of sudden unexpected epileptic death.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study was to analyse the predictive value of cognitive and behavioural factors, in relation to pain, disability and quality of life (QoL) one year after lumbar disc surgery. METHOD: The study design was prospective. Fifty-nine patients scheduled for first time lumbar disc surgery were included. Pain, disability, QoL, coping, fear avoidance beliefs, expected outcome and sick leave were assessed preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. Multiple backward stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to study the contribution of the preoperatively measured independent behavioural/cognitive factors (coping, fear avoidance beliefs and assessed chance to return to work within 3 months) to the dependent variables pain, disability and quality of life at 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: Low expectations on work return within 3 months after surgery was significantly predictive for residual leg pain, odds ratio (OR) = 8.2, back pain, OR = 9.7, disability, OR = 13.8 and sick leave, OR = 19.5. Low QoL, was best predicted by preoperatively high scores on fear avoidance beliefs OR = 6.6 and being a woman OR = 6.0. The regression model explained 26-40{\%} of the variance in pain, disability, QoL and sick leave. CONCLUSIONS: Eliciting patients' expectations on work return after surgery could contribute to early identification of those who run the risk of developing long-term disability and sick-leave},

abstract = {Neuropathic pain, caused by various central and peripheral nerve disorders, is especially problematic because of its severity, chronicity and resistance to simple analgesics. The condition affects 2{\%}-3{\%} of the population, is costly to the health care system and is personally devastating to the people who experience it. The diagnosis of neuropathic pain is based primarily on history (e.g., underlying disorder and distinct pain qualities) and the findings on physical examination (e.g., pattern of sensory disturbance); however, several tests may sometimes be helpful. Important pathophysiologic mechanisms include sodium-and calcium-channel upregulation, spinal hyperexcitability, descending facilitation and aberrant sympathetic-somatic nervous system interactions. Treatments are generally palliative and include conservative nonpharmacologic therapies, drugs and more invasive interventions (e.g., spinal cord stimulation). Individualizing treatment requires consideration of the functional impact of the neuropathic pain (e.g., depression, disability) as well as ongoing evaluation, patient education, reassurance and specialty referral. We propose a primary care algorithm for treatments with the most favourable risk-benefit profile, including topical lidocaine, gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, mixed serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tramadol and opioids. The field of neuropathic pain research and treatment is in the early stages of development, with many unmet goals. In coming years, several advances are expected in the basic and clinical sciences of neuropathic pain, which will provide new and improved therapies for patients who continue to experience this disabling condition},

abstract = {AD, a 45-year-old man, presented with a severe and global anterograde amnesia following surgery for removal of a colloid cyst. Structural neuroimaging confirmed bilateral lesions to the fornix and a small lesion in the basal forebrain. Testing for remote episodic memory of autobiographical events, and for remote semantic memory of personal and public events, and of famous people, revealed that AD had a severe retrograde amnesia for autobiographical episodes that covered his entire lifetime, and a time-limited retrograde amnesia for semantic memory. Because the fornix and basal forebrain lesions disrupted major afferent and efferent pathways of the hippocampus, it was concluded that the integrity of the hippocampus and its projections are needed to retain and/or recover autobiographical memories no matter how old they are. By contrast, hippocampal contribution to semantic memory is time-limited. These findings were interpreted as consistent with Multiple Trace Theory, which holds that the hippocampal system is essential for recovering contextually rich memories no matter how old they are, but is not needed for recovering semantic memories.},

The FBR was significantly reduced in the TBI group (FBR = 0.1121) as compared to the normal control group (FBR = 0.1766). Despite these significant FBR findings indicating prominent atrophic changes of the fornix in TBI patients, the FBR did not relate systematically to neuropsychological outcome. These findings clearly indicate fornix vulnerability in TBI and that current quantitative MR methods are sensitive enough to detect such changes. However, fornix degeneration constitutes only one of many contributing factors to the anatomic basis of TBI-induced cognitive disturbances, as fornix atrophy did not relate systematically to neuropsychological outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances have enabled delivery of high-intensity focused ultrasound through the intact human cranium with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. This preliminary study investigates the use of transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for the treatment of essential tremor. METHODS: From February 2011 through December 2011, in an open-label, uncontrolled study, we used transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound to target the unilateral ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus in 15 patients with severe, medication-refractory essential tremor. We recorded all safety data and measured the effectiveness of tremor suppression using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor to calculate the total score (ranging from 0 to 160), hand subscore (primary outcome, ranging from 0 to 32), and disability subscore (ranging from 0 to 32), with higher scores indicating worse tremor. We assessed the patients' perceptions of treatment efficacy with the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (ranging from 0 to 100{\%}, with higher scores indicating greater perceived disability). RESULTS: Thermal ablation of the thalamic target occurred in all patients. Adverse effects of the procedure included transient sensory, cerebellar, motor, and speech abnormalities, with persistent paresthesias in four patients. Scores for hand tremor improved from 20.4 at baseline to 5.2 at 12 months (P=0.001). Total tremor scores improved from 54.9 to 24.3 (P=0.001). Disability scores improved from 18.2 to 2.8 (P=0.001). Quality-of-life scores improved from 37{\%} to 11{\%} (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, essential tremor improved in 15 patients treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy. Large, randomized, controlled trials will be required to assess the procedure's efficacy and safety. (Funded by the Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01304758.).},

abstract = {Functional imaging studies have shown that certain brain regions, including posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), consistently show greater activity during resting states than during cognitive tasks. This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network. Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated by task demands and what functions it might subserve.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visual field defects sometimes occur after temporal resection surgery. Our purpose was to evaluate the correlation between visual field defects caused by temporal lobe resection and the degree of resection of the Meyer loop, as assessed by diffusion tensor tractography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 14 patients who underwent temporal resection for temporal lobe epilepsy. We obtained presurgical tractographies and then measured the distance between the temporal tip and the anterior limit of the Meyer loop (T-M distance). The degree of resection of the Meyer loop was defined as the distance from the anterior limit of the Meyer loop to the posterior limit of the temporal lobe resection (M-R distance). This was calculated by subtracting the T-M distance from the measured distance between the temporal tip and the posterior limit of the resection (T-R distance). RESULTS: The mean T-M distance was 36.6 mm. The interindividual variation of the distance ranged from 30.0 to 43.2 mm. Although there was no statistically significant correlation between the extent of the visual field defect and the T-R distance, there was a statistically significant correlation between the degree of the visual field defect and the M-R distance. CONCLUSION: The range of interindividual variation for the position of the Meyer loop was rather large, indicating that this variation is the key factor in visual field defects after temporal lobectomy, and the visual field defect appears to be predicted by presurgical tractography. Evaluation of the Meyer loop through the use of tractography seems to be a feasible method, which can be used to predict the visual field defect after temporal lobe resection},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We report the case of a seemingly rare variation of a branch of the trigeminal nerve. This unusual finding is of practical importance to the neurosurgeon because ablation of this nerve(s) in such a case would require modification of technique. The existence of a bifurcated infraorbital nerve is also relevant for application of local anesthesia to portions of the face innervated by the maxillary nerve. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: During cadaveric dissection of the face of a male specimen, 2 branches of the infraorbital nerve were identified emanating onto the face. The 2 branches entered separate osseous canals within the orbit to emerge via 2 infraorbital foramina. INTERVENTION: The unusual variation of the trigeminal nerve branch in the reported case necessitates a change in the way in which the nerve is blocked clinically. A common practice involves blocking the infraorbital nerve as it emerges from the infraorbital foramen. The needle is aimed superiorly, posteriorly, and slightly laterally; however, to provide adequate anesthesia to both branches of the infraorbital nerve, as reported here, a needle can be inserted between the zygomatic arch and the notch of the mandible in the pterygopalatine fossa. After the needle contacts the lateral pterygoid plate, it is withdrawn slightly and angled both superiorly and anteriorly to pass into the pterygopalatine fossa. CONCLUSION: Although apparently uncommon, such derangement of the infraorbital nerve should be kept in mind by surgeons during surgical procedures in the region for treatment of various disorders including trigeminal neuralgia},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The efficiency of radiosurgery is related to its highly precise targeting. We assessed clinically the targeting accuracy of radiosurgical treatment with the Leksell Gamma Knife for trigeminal neuralgia. We also studied the applied radiation dose within the area of focal contrast enhancement on the trigeminal nerve root following radiosurgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From an initial group of 78 patients with trigeminal neuralgia treated with gamma knife radiosurgery using a 90-Gy dose, we analyzed a subgroup of 65 patients for whom 6-month follow-up MRI showed focal contrast enhancement of the trigeminal nerve. Follow-up MRI was spatially coregistered to the radiosurgical planning MRI. Target accuracy was assessed from deviation of the coordinates of the intended target compared with the center of enhancement on postoperative MRI. Radiation dose delivered at the borders of contrast enhancement was evaluated. RESULTS: The median deviation of the coordinates between the intended target and the center of contrast enhancement was 0.91 mm in Euclidean space. The radiation doses fitting within the borders of the contrast enhancement of the trigeminal nerve root ranged from 49 to 85 Gy (median value, 77 +/- 8.7 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: The median deviation found in clinical assessment of gamma knife treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is low and compatible with its high rate of efficiency. Focal enhancement of the trigeminal nerve after radiosurgery occurred in 83{\%} of our patients and was not associated with clinical outcome. Focal enhancement borders along the nerve root fit with a median dose of 77 +/- 8.7 Gy},

MTA {\textgreater} or = 2 showed a trend for greater left sided hippocampal atrophy versus MTA {\textless} 2 groups at baseline (P(corrected) = 0.08). Higher MTA scores were associated with progressive atrophy of the subiculum and the CA1-3 subregions. The MTA {\textless} 2 group demonstrated significant bilateral atrophy progression at follow-up (left P(corrected) = 0.008; right P(corrected) = 0.05). Relative to MTA {\textless} 2 nonconverters, MTA {\textless} 2 converters showed further involvement of the subiculum and CA1 and additional involvement of CA2-3 at follow-up. Right CA1 atrophy was significantly associated with conversion to dementia (for 1 mm greater right CA1 radial distance subjects had 50{\%} reduced hazard for conversion). Greater CA1 and subicular atrophy can be demonstrated early and is predictive of future conversion to AD, whereas CA2-3 involvement becomes more evident as the disease progresses.},

@article{Chen2016,
abstract = {Introduction: Tractography analysis in group-based studies across large populations has been difficult to implement. We propose Selective Automated Group Integrated Tractography (SAGIT), an automated group tractography software platform that incorporates multiple diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) practices which will allow great accessibility to group-wise dMRI. We use a merged tractography approach that permits evaluation of tractography datasets at the group level. We also introduce an image normalized overlap score (NOS) that measures the quality of the group tractography results. We deploy SAGIT to evaluate deterministic and probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution (CST det , CST prob ) tractography, eXtended Streamline Tractography (XST), and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) in their ability to delineate different neuroanatomy, as well as validating NOS across these different brain regions. Materials and methods: Magnetic resonance sequences were acquired from 42 healthy adults. Anatomical and group registrations were performed using Automated Normalization Tools. Cortical segmentation was performed using FreeSurfer. Four tractography algorithms were used to delineate six sets of neuroanatomy: fornix, facial/vestibular-cochlear cranial nerve complex, vagus nerve, rubral-cerebellar decussation, optic radiation, and auditory radiation. The tracts were generated both with and without region of interest filters. The generated visual reports were then evaluated by five neuroscientists. Results: At a group level, merged tractography demonstrated that different methods have different fiber distribution characteristics. CST prob is prone to false-positives, and thereby suitable in anatomy with strong priors. CST det and XST are more conservative, but have greater difficulty resolving hemispherical decussation and distant crossing projections. DTT consistently shows the worst reproducibility across the anatomies. Linear regression of rater scores against NOS shows significant (p {\textless} 0.05) correlation of the two sets of scores in filtered tractography. However, correlations are not significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) for unfiltered tractography. Conclusion: The tractography results demonstrated reliable and consistent performance of SAGIT across multiple subjects and techniques. Through SAGIT, we quantifiably demonstrated that different algorithms showed different strengths and weaknesses at a group level. While no single algorithm seems to be suitable for all anatomical tasks, it is useful to consider the use of a mix of algorithms for different anatomical segments. SAGIT appears to be a promising group-wise tractography analysis approach for this purpose.},

abstract = {Tensor field visualization is a challenging task due in part to the multi-variate nature of individual tensor samples. Glyphs convey tensor variables by mapping the tensor eigenvectors and eigenvalues to the orientation and shape of a geometric primitive, such as a cuboid or ellipsoid. Though widespread, cuboids and ellipsoids have problems of asymmetry and visual ambiguity. Cuboids can display misleading orientation for tensors with underlying rotational symmetry. Ellipsoids differing in shape can be confused, from certain viewpoints, because of similarities in profile and shading. This paper addresses the problems of asymmetry and ambiguity with a new tunable continuum of glyphs based on superquadric surfaces. Superquadric tensor glyphs enjoy the necessary symmetry properties of ellipsoids, while also imitating cuboids and cylinders to better convey shape and orientation, where appropriate. The new glyphs are demonstrated on fields of diffusion tensors from the human brain.},

@article{Pollock2006,
abstract = {OBJECT: Over the past 15 years stereotactic radiosurgery has become an accepted surgical option for patients with medically unresponsive trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The mechanism whereby radiosurgery causes pain relief remains unclear. METHODS: A review of recent papers on the radiosurgical management of TN reveals a correlation between maximum prescription dose and facial pain outcomes (p = 0.03) and between maximum prescription dose and new-onset trigeminal dysfunction (p {\textless} 0.01). In five of six studies in which investigators specifically analyzed whether there is any relationship between postradiosurgical trigeminal dysfunction and facial pain outcomes, there was a statistically significant greater chance of patients being pain free without medications if new trigeminal dysfunction developed after radiosurgery. Likewise, combining the results of two small series on repeated radiosurgery for TN also showed a significant correlation between postradiosurgical trigeminal dysfunction and facial pain outcomes (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Although the quality of data available does not permit a formal metaanalysis of radiosurgery for TN, the preponderance of information supports an association between the development of facial sensory loss and pain relief after radiosurgery. Consequently, radiosurgery should be considered a destructive technique in which the goal is similar to that in other percutaneous ablative techniques used to manage TN: create sufficient damage to the trigeminal system to achieve pain relief, but not so much injury that the patient is at risk for deafferentation pain syndromes},

abstract = {The character and timing of gyral development is one manifestation of the complex orchestration of human brain development. The ability to quantify these changes would not only allow for deeper understanding of cortical development, but also conceivably allow for improved detection of pathologies. This paper describes a FreeSurfer based image-processing analysis "pipeline" or methodology that inputs an MRI volume, corrects possible contrast defects, creates surface reconstructions, and outputs various curvature-based function analyses. A technique of performing neonate reconstructions using FreeSurfer, which has not been possible previously due to inverted image contrast in pre-myelinated brains, is described. Once surfaces are reconstructed, the analysis component of the pipeline incorporates several surface-based curvature functions found in literature (principle curvatures, Gaussian, mean curvature, "curvedness", and Willmore Bending Energy). We consider the problem of analyzing curvatures from different sized brains by introducing a Gaussian-curvature based variable-radius filter. Segmented volume data is also analyzed for folding measures: a gyral folding index (gyrification-white index GWI), and a gray-white matter junction folding index (WMF). A very simple curvature-based classifier is proposed that has the potential to discriminate between certain classes of subjects. We also present preliminary results of this curvature analysis pipeline on nine neonate subjects (30.4 weeks through 40.3 weeks Corrected Gestational Age), 3 children (2, 3, and 7 years) and 3 adults (33, 37, and 39 years). Initial results demonstrate that curvature measures and functions across our subjects peaked at term, with a gradual decline through early childhood and further decline continuing through to adults. We can also discriminate older neonates, children, and adults based on curvature analysis. Using a variable radius Gaussian-curvature filter, we also observed that the per-unit bending energy of neonate brain surfaces was also much higher than the children and adults.},

abstract = {In the current study, the feasibility and reproducibility of in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the spinal cord in normal mice are illustrated followed by its application to mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) to detect and differentiate axon and myelin damage. Axial diffusivity, describing water movement along the axonal fiber tract, in all regions of spinal cord white matter from EAE-affected C57BL/6 mice was significantly decreased compared to normal mice, whereas there was no statistically significant change in radial diffusivity, describing water movement across the fiber tract. Furthermore, a direct comparison between DTI and histology from a single mouse demonstrated a decrease in axial diffusivity that was supported by widespread staining of antibody against beta-amyloid precursor protein. Regionally elevated radial diffusivity corresponded with locally diminished Luxol fast blue staining in the same tissue from the EAE mouse cord. Our findings suggest that axonal damage is more widespread than myelin damage in the spinal cord white matter of mice with EAE and that in vivo DTI may provide a sensitive and specific measure of white matter injury.},

abstract = {Although previous studies have demonstrated that the hippocampus plays a role in pain processing, the role of hippocampal subfields is uncertain. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and chronic pain in nondemented older adults. The study sample included 86 community-residing adults age 70 or older who were free of dementia and recruited from the Einstein Aging Study. Chronic pain was defined as pain over the last 3 months, that was moderate or severe (minimum rating of 4 out of 10) most, or all of the time. Hippocampal subfield volumes were estimated using FreeSurfer software. We modeled the association between chronic pain and hippocampal and subfield volume using linear regression. The sample had a mean age of 80 and was 58{\%} female. Chronic pain, present in 55{\%} of the sample, was associated with smaller right and total hippocampal volumes, particularly in women, after adjusting for age, education, and intracranial volume (eTICV). In addition, in women, volume was significantly reduced in participants with chronic pain in right CA2-3 ($\beta$=-0.35, p=0.010), right CA4-DG ($\beta$=-0.35, p=0.011), left presubiculum ($\beta$=-0.29, p=0.030), and left fimbria ($\beta$=-0.30, p=0.023). In men, chronic pain was not associated with the volume of any of the hippocampal subfield volumes. Chronic pain in women is associated with a reduction in the volume of right hippocampus and also selected hippocampal subfields. Future studies should clarify the mechanisms underlying the association between regional hippocampal volumes and chronic pain, particularly in women.},

We isolated five meaningful resting-state networks across the groups, of which only the default mode network (DMN) exhibited deviations from healthy controls. All patient groups showed decreased connectivity of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) to the posterior constituents of the DMN, and increased connectivity to the insular cortex in proportion to the intensity of pain. Multiple DMN regions, especially the MPFC, exhibited increased high frequency oscillations, conjoined with decreased phase locking with parietal regions involved in processing attention. Both phase and frequency changes correlated to pain duration in OA and CBP patients. Thus chronic pain seems to reorganize the dynamics of the DMN and as such reflect the maladaptive physiology of different types of chronic pain.},

abstract = {The qualities of chronic neuropathic pain (NeP) may be informative about the different mechanisms of pain. We previously developed a 2-factor model of NeP that described an underlying structure among sensory descriptors on the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. The goal of this study was to confirm the correlated 2-factor model of NeP. Individual descriptive scores from the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire were analyzed. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test a correlated 2-factor model. Factor 1 (stabbing pain) was characterized by high loadings on stabbing, sharp, and shooting sensory items; factor 2 (heavy pain) was characterized by high loadings on heavy, gnawing, and aching items. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis strongly supported the correlated 2-factor model. PERSPECTIVE: This article validates a model that describes the qualities of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. These data suggest that specific pain qualities may be associated with pain mechanisms or may be useful for predicting treatment response.},

abstract = {Pharmacological treatment of pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) is challenging due to the many underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Few controlled trials show adequate pain control in this population. Emerging evidence suggests that pain might be more effectively classified and treated according to symptoms and underlying mechanisms. The new mechanism-based classification we propose here distinguishes nine types of MS-related pain: trigeminal neuralgia and Lhermitte's phenomenon (paroxysmal neuropathic pain due to ectopic impulse generation along primary afferents), ongoing extremity pain (deafferentation pain secondary to lesion in the spino-thalamo-cortical pathways), painful tonic spasms and spasticity pain (mixed pains secondary to lesions in the central motor pathways but mediated by muscle nociceptors), pain associated with optic neuritis (nerve trunk pain originating from nervi nervorum), musculoskeletal pains (nociceptive pain arising from postural abnormalities secondary to motor disorders), migraine (nociceptive pain favored by predisposing factors or secondary to midbrain lesions), and treatment-induced pains. Identification of various types of MS-related pain will allow appropriate targeted pharmacological treatment and improve clinical practice},

abstract = {OBJECT: Neuroimages often reveal that the trigeminal or facial nerve comes in contact with vessels but does not produce symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) or hemifacial spasm (HFS). The authors conducted this study to determine how often the trigeminal and facial nerves came in contact with vessels in individuals not suffering from TN or HFS. They also investigated the correlation between aging and the anatomical measurements of the trigeminal and facial nerves. METHODS: Between November 2005 and August 2006, 220 nerves in 110 individuals (60 women and 50 men; mean age 55.1 years, range 19-85 years) who had undergone brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for other reasons were studied. The lengths, angles, ratio, and contact points were measured in each individual. A correlation between each parameter and age was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The mean (+/- standard deviation) length of the trigeminal nerve was 9.66 +/- 1.71 mm, the mean distance between the bilateral trigeminal nerves was 31.97 +/- 1.82 mm, and the mean angle between the trigeminal nerve and the midline was 9.71 +/- 5.83 degrees . The trigeminal nerve was significantly longer in older patients. Of 220 trigeminal nerves, 108 (49.0{\%}; 51 women and 57 men) came in contact with vasculature. There was 1 contact point in 99 nerves (45{\%}) and 2 contact points in 9 nerves (4.1{\%}). Contact without deviation of the nerve was seen in 91 individuals (43 women and 48 men), and mild deviation was noted in 17 individuals (8 women and 9 men). There was no moderate or severe deviation in any individual in this series. The mean length of the facial nerve was 29.78 +/- 2.31 mm, the mean distance between the bilateral facial nerves was 28.65 +/- 2.22 mm, the angle between the nerve and midline was 69.68 +/- 5.84 degrees , and the vertical ratio at the porus acusticus was 0.467 +/- 0.169. Of all facial nerves, 173 (78.6{\%}; 101 in women and 72 in men) came in contact with some vasculature. Contact without deviation was seen on 64 sides (in 37 women and 27 men), mild deviation on 98 sides (in 57 women and 41 men), and moderate deviation on 11 sides (in 7 women and 4 men). There was no severe deviation of the facial nerve in this series. The proximal length of the facial nerve, interval, angle, and ratio against the age were significantly shorter or smaller in the older individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in asymptomatic individuals in this study will help in deciding which findings observed on MR images may cause symptoms. In addition, the authors describe the variations of normal anatomy in older individuals. Knowledge of the normal anatomy helps to hone the diagnostic practices for microvascular decompression, which may increase the feasible results on such surgery},

abstract = {It has been proposed that the capacity to code the 'like me' analogy between self and others constitutes a basic prerequisite and a starting point for social cognition. It is by means of this self/other equivalence that meaningful social bonds can be established, that we can recognize others as similar to us, and that imitation can take place. In this article I discuss recent neurophysiological and brain imaging data on monkeys and humans, showing that the 'like me' analogy may rest upon a series of 'mirror-matching' mechanisms. A new conceptual tool able to capture the richness of the experiences we share with others is introduced: the shared manifold of intersubjectivity. I propose that all kinds of interpersonal relations (imitation, empathy and the attribution of intentions) depend, at a basic level, on the constitution of a shared manifold space. This shared space is functionally characterized by automatic, unconscious embodied simulation routines.},

abstract = {Scene parsing, or semantic segmentation, consists in labeling each pixel in an image with the category of the object it belongs to. It is a challenging task that involves the simultaneous detection, segmentation and recognition of all the objects in the image. The scene parsing method proposed here starts by computing a tree of segments from a graph of pixel dissimilarities. Simultaneously, a set of dense feature vectors is computed which encodes regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The feature extractor is a multiscale convolutional network trained from raw pixels. The feature vectors associated with the segments covered by each node in the tree are aggregated and fed to a classifier which produces an estimate of the distribution of object categories contained in the segment. A subset of tree nodes that cover the image are then selected so as to maximize the average "purity" of the class distributions, hence maximizing the overall likelihood that each segment will contain a single object. The convolutional network feature extractor is trained end-to-end from raw pixels, alleviating the need for engineered features. After training, the system is parameter free. The system yields record accuracies on the Stanford Background Dataset (8 classes), the Sift Flow Dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona Dataset (170 classes) while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a 320 $\backslash$times 240 image labeling in less than 1 second.},

abstract = {The transition from acute to chronic pain appears to occur in discrete pathophysiological and histopathological steps. Stimuli initiating a nociceptive response vary, but receptors and endogenous defence mechanisms in the periphery interact in a similar manner regardless of the insult. Chemical, mechanical, and thermal receptors, along with leucocytes and macrophages, determine the intensity, location, and duration of noxious events. Noxious stimuli are transduced to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where amino acid and peptide transmitters activate second-order neurones. Spinal neurones then transmit signals to the brain. The resultant actions by the individual involve sensory-discriminative, motivational-affective, and modulatory processes in an attempt to limit or stop the painful process. Under normal conditions, noxious stimuli diminish as healing progresses and pain sensation lessens until minimal or no pain is detected. Persistent, intense pain, however, activates secondary mechanisms both at the periphery and within the central nervous system that cause allodynia, hyperalgesia, and hyperpathia that can diminish normal functioning. These changes begin in the periphery with upregulation of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and interleukin-1beta-sensitizing first-order neurones, which eventually sensitize second-order spinal neurones by activating N-methyl-d-aspartic acid channels and signalling microglia to alter neuronal cytoarchitecture. Throughout these processes, prostaglandins, endocannabinoids, ion-specific channels, and scavenger cells all play a key role in the transformation of acute to chronic pain. A better understanding of the interplay among these substances will assist in the development of agents designed to ameliorate or reverse chronic pain},

@article{Aggleton1999,
abstract = {By utilizing new information from both clinical and experimental (lesion, electrophysiological, and gene-activation) studies with animals, the anatomy underlying anterograde amnesia has been reformulated. The distinction between temporal lobe and diencephalic amnesia is of limited value in that a common feature of anterograde amnesia is damage to part of an "extended hippocampal system" comprising the hippocampus, the fornix, the mamillary bodies, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. This view, which can be traced back to Delay and Brion (1969), differs from other recent models in placing critical importance on the efferents from the hippocampus via the fornix to the diencephalon. These are necessary for the encoding and, hence, the effective subsequent recall of episodic memory. An additional feature of this hippocampal-anterior thalamic axis is the presence of projections back from the diencephalon to the temporal cortex and hippocampus that also support episodic memory. In contrast, this hippocampal system is not required for tests of item recognition that primarily tax familiarity judgements. Familiarity judgements reflect an independent process that depends on a distinct system involving the perirhinal cortex of the temporal lobe and the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. In the large majority of amnesic cases both the hippocampal-anterior thalamic and the perirhinal-medial dorsal thalamic systems are compromised, leading to severe deficits in both recall and recognition.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgical treatment of the proximal trigeminal nerve is used to relieve the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. The mechanism of the radiosurgical effect is not understood. METHODS: Two adult baboons underwent stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiosurgery, using a gamma knife. A single 4-mm isocenter was targeted to each proximal trigeminal nerve, just anterior to the pons, to deliver a maximal dose of 80 or 100 Gy (total of four nerves). A nonirradiated baboon brain and nerves served as control specimens. Six months after treatment, magnetic resonance imaging was again performed and the brains and nerves were studied using light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging indicated a 4-mm-diameter area of contrast enhancement at the target site in each nerve. All irradiated nerves exhibited axonal degeneration and mild edema at the target, with remnants of some myelinated axons. Large and small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers were affected. No inflammation was observed. Nerve necrosis was identified after 100-Gy treatment. The trigeminal ganglion appeared normal. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery at 80 Gy causes focal axonal degeneration of the trigeminal nerve. At higher doses, partial nerve necrosis is observed. We think that these effects influence the physiological features of trigeminal neuralgia},

abstract = {The existence of a posterolateral thalamic relay nucleus for pain and temperature sensation was postulated in 1911, on the basis of the stroke-induced analgesia and thermanaesthesia found paradoxically in patients with thalamic pain syndrome. Pain or temperature sensations can be evoked in humans by electrical stimulation in a vaguely defined region of the posterolateral thalamus. Here we use anterograde tracing and single unit recordings to demonstrate that there is a distinct nucleus in the posterior thalamus of the macaque monkey that receives a dense, topographic input from spinothalamic lamina I neurons and in which almost all neurons are nociceptive- or thermoreceptive-specific. Immunohistochemical staining showed that this nucleus is defined by a dense calbindin-positive fibre plexus in the macaque, so we applied the same staining method to sections of human thalamus. We found a nearly identical fibre plexus localized within a distinct nucleus that is cytoarchitectonically homologous to the lamina I relay nucleus in the macaque thalamus. The stereotaxic coordinates of this nucleus and its location relative to the main somatosensory representation fit clinical descriptions of the pain-producing region in humans. We conclude that this is a specific thalamic nucleus for pain and temperature sensation in both monkey and human.},

abstract = {Chronic pain is the greatest source of disability globally and claims related to chronic pain feature in many insurance and medico-legal cases. Brain imaging (for example, functional MRI, PET, EEG and magnetoencephalography) is widely considered to have potential for diagnosis, prognostication, and prediction of treatment outcome in patients with chronic pain. In this Consensus Statement, a presidential task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain examines the capabilities of brain imaging in the diagnosis of chronic pain, and the ethical and legal implications of its use in this way. The task force emphasizes that the use of brain imaging in this context is in a discovery phase, but has the potential to increase our understanding of the neural underpinnings of chronic pain, inform the development of therapeutic agents, and predict treatment outcomes for use in personalized pain management. The task force proposes standards of evidence that must be satisfied before any brain imaging measure can be considered suitable for clinical or legal purposes. The admissibility of such evidence in legal cases also strongly depends on laws that vary between jurisdictions. For these reasons, the task force concludes that the use of brain imaging findings to support or dispute a claim of chronic pain - effectively as a pain lie detector - is not warranted, but that imaging should be used to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned. However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Ma},

abstract = {Fundamental to the concept of idiopathic or primary headache, including migraine, tension-type headache and cluster headache, is the currently accepted view that these conditions are due to abnormal brain function with completely normal brain structure. Cluster headache is one such idiopathic headache with many similarities to migraine, including normal brain structure on magnetic resonance imaging and abnormal function in the hypothalamic grey matter by positron emission tomography. Given the consistency of the positron emission tomography findings with the clinical presentation, we sought to assess whether the brains of such patients were structurally normal. We used voxel-based morphometry, an objective and automated method of analyzing changes in brain structure, to study the structure of the brains of patients with cluster headache. We found a co-localization of structural changes and changes in local brain activity with positron emission tomography in the same area of the brain in the same patients. The results indicate that the current view of the neurobiology of cluster headache requires complete revision and that this periodic headache is associated with a hitherto unrecognized brain abnormality in the hypothalamic region. We believe that voxel-based morphometry has the potential to change in the most fundamental way our concept of primary headache disorders, requiring a radical reappraisal of the tenet of structural normality.},

In contrast, the underlying fiber configurations are not, as bending or fanning configurations are inherently asymmetric. We propose to dismiss the symmetry of the FOD to additionally encode the asymmetry of the underlying fiber configuration. This is of particular importance for low resolution images that are common in diffusion weighted imaging. We set up the mathematical foundations and geometric interpretations of asymmetric FODs and show how one can benefit from these considerations. We infer a continuity condition that is used as a prior during FOD estimation by constrained spherical deconvolution. This new prior shows superior performance in comparison to other spatial regularization strategies in reliability and accuracy.},

We formulate the atlas creation as a maximum likelihood problem which the proposed method solves using a generalized Expectation Maximization (EM) framework. Additionally, the algorithm employs an outlier rejection and denoising strategy to produce sharp probabilistic maps of certain bundles of interest. We test this algorithm on synthetic and real data, and evaluate its stability against initialization. We demonstrate labeling a novel subject using the resulting spatial atlas and evaluate the accuracy of this labeling. Consistency clustering is a viable tool for completely automatic white-matter atlas construction for sub-populations and the resulting atlas is potentially useful for making diffusion measurements in a common coordinate system to identify pathology related changes or developmental trends.},

Four dataset-specific strategies are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual template, the average shape version of the closest to average template, a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that, with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy, optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts the study of diseased hippocampi. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We describe a technique that uses tractography to drive the local fiber model estimation. Existing techniques use independent estimation at each voxel so there is no running knowledge of confidence in the estimated model fit. We formulate fiber tracking as recursive estimation: at each step of tracing the fiber, the current estimate is guided by those previous. To do this we perform tractography within a filter framework and use a discrete mixture of Gaussian tensors to model the signal. Starting from a seed point, each fiber is traced to its termination using an unscented Kalman filter to simultaneously fit the local model to the signal and propagate in the most consistent direction. Despite the presence of noise and uncertainty, this provides a causal estimate of the local structure at each point along the fiber. Using two- and three-fiber models we demonstrate in synthetic experiments that this approach significantly improves the angular resolution at crossings and branchings. In vivo experiments confirm the ability to trace through regions known to contain such crossing and branching while providing inherent path regularization.},

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

abstract = {Fibromyalgia is an intractable widespread pain disorder that is most frequently diagnosed in women. It has traditionally been classified as either a musculoskeletal disease or a psychological disorder. Accumulating evidence now suggests that fibromyalgia may be associated with CNS dysfunction. In this study, we investigate anatomical changes in the brain associated with fibromyalgia. Using voxel-based morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance brain images, we examined the brains of 10 female fibromyalgia patients and 10 healthy controls. We found that fibromyalgia patients had significantly less total gray matter volume and showed a 3.3 times greater age-associated decrease in gray matter than healthy controls. The longer the individuals had had fibromyalgia, the greater the gray matter loss, with each year of fibromyalgia being equivalent to 9.5 times the loss in normal aging. In addition, fibromyalgia patients demonstrated significantly less gray matter density than healthy controls in several brain regions, including the cingulate, insular and medial frontal cortices, and parahippocampal gyri. The neuroanatomical changes that we see in fibromyalgia patients contribute additional evidence of CNS involvement in fibromyalgia. In particular, fibromyalgia appears to be associated with an acceleration of age-related changes in the very substance of the brain. Moreover, the regions in which we demonstrate objective changes may be functionally linked to core features of the disorder including affective disturbances and chronic widespread pain},

abstract = {We previously discovered that when faced with a challenging cognitive task in the context of pain, some people prioritize task performance, while in others, pain results in poorer performance. These behaviours, designated respectively as A- and P-types (for attention dominates vs pain dominates), may reflect pain coping strategies, resilience or vulnerabilities to develop chronic pain, or predict the efficacy of treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Here, we used a cognitive interference task and pain stimulation in 80 subjects to interrogate psychophysical, psychological, brain structure and function that distinguish these behavioural strategies. During concurrent pain, the A group exhibited faster task reaction times (RTs) compared to nonpain trials, whereas the P group had slower RTs during pain compared to nonpain trials, with the A group being 143 ms faster than the P group. Brain imaging revealed structural and functional brain features that characterized these behavioural strategies. Compared to the performance-oriented A group, the P group had (1) more gray matter in regions implicated in pain and salience (anterior insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, caudate), (2) greater functional connectivity in sensorimotor and salience resting-state networks, (3) less white matter integrity in the internal and external capsule, anterior thalamic radiation and corticospinal tract, but (4) were indistinguishable based on sex, pain sensitivity, neuroticism, and pain catastrophizing. These data may represent neural underpinnings of how task performance vs pain is prioritized and provide a framework for developing personalized pain therapy approaches that are based on behaviour-structure-function organization.},

abstract = {Episodic memory is a core feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Impaired episodic memory in AD results from the dysfunction of an integrated network and involves both gray and white matter pathologies. We explored the neural correlates of episodic memory in AD, MCI and healthy aging by correlating a measure of episodic memory with hippocampal volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the cingulum and fornix. Episodic memory was associated with hippocampal volume and MD of the cingulum and fornix. In contrast, there were fewer significant associations between episodic memory and FA. These findings support a relationship between episodic memory and hippocampal circuitry, and suggest that MD is a more sensitive marker of decreased white matter integrity in the study of AD and MCI than FA. Furthermore, MD was significantly associated with hippocampal volume, indicating that white matter pathology is not completely independent of gray matter pathology. However, the pattern of diffusivity differences in AD and MCI implies a more complex pathology than simply Wallerian degeneration.},

abstract = {Functional imaging with positron emission tomography and functional MRI has revolutionized studies of the human brain. Understanding the organization of brain systems, especially those used for cognition, remains limited, however, because no methods currently exist for noninvasive tracking of neuronal connections between functional regions [Crick, F. {\&} Jones, E. (1993) Nature (London) 361, 109-110]. Detailed connectivities have been studied in animals through invasive tracer techniques, but these invasive studies cannot be done in humans, and animal results cannot always be extrapolated to human systems. We have developed noninvasive neuronal fiber tracking for use in living humans, utilizing the unique ability of MRI to characterize water diffusion. We reconstructed fiber trajectories throughout the brain by tracking the direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber direction) from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks that join anatomically or functionally (functional MRI) defined regions. We demonstrate diffusion tracking of fiber bundles in a variety of white matter classes with examples in the corpus callosum, geniculo-calcarine, and subcortical association pathways. Tracks covered long distances, navigated through divergences and tight curves, and manifested topological separations in the geniculo-calcarine tract consistent with tracer studies in animals and retinotopy studies in humans. Additionally, previously undescribed topologies were revealed in the other pathways. This approach enhances the power of modern imaging by enabling study of fiber connections among anatomically and functionally defined brain regions in individual human subjects.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is used to alleviate the motor symptoms of both Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia. We tested the hypothesis that PD and dystonia are characterized by different temporal patterns of synchronized oscillations in the GPi, and that the dopaminergic loss in PD makes the basal ganglia more susceptible to oscillatory activity. METHODS: Neuronal firing and local field potentials (LFPs) were simultaneously recorded from the GPi in four PD patients and seven dystonia patients using two independently driven microelectrodes. RESULTS: In the PD patients, beta (11-30Hz) oscillations were observed in the LFPs and the firing activity of 30{\%} of the neurons was significantly coherent with the LFP. However, in the dystonia group, the peak frequency of LFP oscillations was lower (8-20Hz) and there was a significantly smaller proportion of neurons (10{\%}) firing in coherence with the LFP (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that synchronization of neuronal firing with LFP oscillations is a more prominent feature in PD than in dystonia. SIGNIFICANCE: This study adds to the growing evidence that dopaminergic loss in PD may increase the sensitivity of the basal ganglia network to rhythmic oscillatory inputs.},

abstract = {Although phantom-limb pain is a frequent consequence of the amputation of an extremity, little is known about its origin. On the basis of the demonstration of substantial plasticity of the somatosensory cortex after amputation or somatosensory deafferentation in adult monkeys, it has been suggested that cortical reorganization could account for some non-painful phantom-limb phenomena in amputees and that cortical reorganization has an adaptive (that is, pain-preventing) function. Theoretical and empirical work on chronic back pain has revealed a positive relationship between the amount of cortical alteration and the magnitude of pain, so we predicted that cortical reorganization and phantom-limb pain should be positively related. Using non-invasive neuromagnetic imaging techniques to determine cortical reorganization in humans, we report a very strong direct relationship (r = 0.93) between the amount of cortical reorganization and the magnitude of phantom limb pain (but not non-painful phantom phenomena) experienced after arm amputation. These data indicate that phantom-limb pain is related to, and may be a consequence of, plastic changes in primary somatosensory cortex.},

abstract = {Neuropathic pain-that is, pain arising directly from a lesion or disease that affects the somatosensory system-is a common clinical problem, and typically causes patients intense distress. Patients with neuropathic pain have sensory abnormalities on clinical examination and experience pain of diverse types, some spontaneous and others provoked. Spontaneous pain typically manifests as ongoing burning pain or paroxysmal electric shock-like sensations. Provoked pain includes pain induced by various stimuli or even gentle brushing (dynamic mechanical allodynia). Recent clinical and neurophysiological studies suggest that the various pain types arise through distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Ongoing burning pain primarily reflects spontaneous hyperactivity in nociceptive-fibre pathways, originating from 'irritable' nociceptors, regenerating nerve sprouts or denervated central neurons. Paroxysmal sensations can be caused by several mechanisms; for example, electric shock-like sensations probably arise from high-frequency bursts generated in demyelinated non-nociceptive A$\beta$ fibres. Most human and animal findings suggest that brush-evoked allodynia originates from A$\beta$ fibres projecting onto previously sensitized nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn, with additional contributions from plastic changes in the brainstem and thalamus. Here, we propose that the emerging mechanism-based approach to the study of neuropathic pain might aid the tailoring of therapy to the individual patient, and could be useful for drug development.},

Two new articles provide intriguing evidence that myelination may be an underappreciated mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity: one study reported increased myelination associated with extensive piano playing, another indicated that rats have increased myelination of the corpus callosum when raised in environments providing increased social interaction and cognitive stimulation. These articles make it clear that activity-dependent effects on myelination cannot be considered strictly a developmental event. They raise the question of whether myelination is an overlooked mechanism of activity-dependent plasticity, extending in humans until at least age 30. It has been argued that regulating the speed of conduction across long fiber tracts would have a major influence on synaptic response, by coordinating the timing of afferent input to maximize temporal summation. The increase in synaptic amplitude could be as large as neurotransmitter-based mechanisms of plasticity, such as LTP. These new findings raise a larger question: How did the oligodendrocytes know they were practicing the piano or that their environment was socially complex?},

METHODS: The neural, arterial, and venous anatomy of the insula and sylvian fissure were examined in 43 cerebral hemispheres. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of gyri and sulci of the frontoparietal and temporal opercula had a constant relationship to the insular gyri and sulci and provided landmarks for approaching different parts of the insula. The most lateral lenticulostriate artery, an important landmark in insular surgery, arose 14.6 mm from the apex of the insula and penetrated the anterior perforated substance 15.3 mm medial to the limen insulae. The superior trunk of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and its branches supplied the anterior, middle, and posterior short gyri; the anterior limiting sulcus; the short sulci; and the insular apex. The inferior trunk supplied the posterior long gyrus, inferior limiting sulcus, and limen area in most hemispheres. Both of these trunks frequently contributed to the supply of the central insular sulcus and the anterior long gyrus. The areas of insular supply of the superior and inferior trunks did not overlap. The most constant insular area of supply by the cortical MCA branches was from the prefrontal and precentral arteries that supplied the anterior and middle short gyri, respectively. The largest insular perforating arteries usually arose from the central and angular arteries and most commonly entered the posterior half of the central insular sulcus and posterior long gyrus. Insular veins drained predominantly to the deep middle cerebral vein, although frequent connections to the superficial venous system were found. Of all the insular veins, the precentral insular vein was the one that most commonly connected to the superficial sylvian vein.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study used reliable and validated instruments to compare pain severity in multiple sclerosis (MS) to that in other chronic painful conditions, and to examine relationships between chronic pain in MS and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: Ninety-nine MS patients completed a self-administered survey comprised of the Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Pain severity was not different between MS patients with pain and rheumatoid arthritis (P = 0.77) or osteoarthritis (P = 0.98) patients. Chronic pain in MS was less often neurogenic than non-neurogenic, although severity of neurogenic pain was greater than that of non-neurogenic pain (P = 0.048). Chronic pain in MS was found to have no significant relationship to age, disease duration or disease course. Instead, we found that pain was correlated with aspects of HRQOL, particularly mental health (r = 0.44, P {\textless} 0.0001) versus physical functioning (r = 0.19, P {\textgreater} 0.05). Chronic pain was significantly related to anxiety and depression for females but not for males with MS. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain in MS is as severe as pain in arthritic conditions and is associated with reduced HRQOL. Thus, pain can be a significant symptom for MS patients and the need for treatment may be underestimated},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful tool for mapping neural histoarchitecture in vivo. However, DTI can only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel due to the constraints of the tensor model. For example, DTI cannot resolve fibers crossing, bending, or twisting within an individual voxel. Intravoxel fiber crossing can be resolved using q-space diffusion imaging, but q-space imaging requires large pulsed field gradients and time-intensive sampling. It is also possible to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signal, but mixture modeling requires a model of the underlying diffusion process.Recently, it has been shown that the HARDI signal can be reconstructed model-independently using a spherical tomographic inversion called the Funk-Radon transform, also known as the spherical Radon transform. The resulting imaging method, termed q-ball imaging, can resolve multiple intravoxel fiber orientations and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion process such as Gaussianity or multi-Gaussianity. The present paper reviews the theory of q-ball imaging and describes a simple linear matrix formulation for the q-ball reconstruction based on spherical radial basis function interpolation. Open aspects of the q-ball reconstruction algorithm are discussed.},

abstract = {To accurately predict the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at its predementia stage would be a major breakthrough from both therapeutic and research standpoints. In this review, our focus is on markers obtained with structural imaging--especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)--and on studies of subjects at risk of developing AD. Among the latter, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is currently the most commonly accepted reference, and therefore is specially targeted in this review. MCI refers to patients with significant but isolated memory impairment relative to subjects of identical age. Consistent with established histopathological data, structural imaging studies comparing patients with early probable AD to healthy aged subjects have shown that the most specific and sensitive features of AD at this stage are hippocampal and entorhinal cortex atrophy, especially when combined with a reduced volume of the temporal neocortex. MCI patients have significant hippocampal atrophy when compared to aged normal controls. When comparing patients with probable AD to MCI subjects, hippocampal region atrophy significantly extends to the neighboring temporal association neocortex. However, only longitudinal studies of MCI subjects are suited to assess (in a retrospective way) the predictive value of initial atrophy measurements for progression to AD. Few such studies have been published so far and for the most they were based on small samples. Furthermore, the comparison among studies is clouded by differences in both populations studied and MRI methodology used. Nevertheless, comparing the initial MRI data of at-risk subjects who convert to AD at follow-up to those of nonconverters suggests that a reduced association temporal neocortex volume combined with hippocampal or anterior cingulate cortex atrophy may be the best predictor of progression to AD. These data, although still preliminary, are consistent with postmortem studies describing the hierarchical progression of tau lesions in normal aging and early stages of AD, such that damage to the medial temporal lobe and association cortex would account for the memory and nonmemory cognitive impairments, respectively, the combination of which is required to operationally define probable AD. Future research in this field should capitalize on thorough methodology for brain structure delineation, and combine atrophy measurements to cognitive and/or functional imaging data.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a new approach for three-dimensional registration of MR fractional anisotropy images with T1-weighted anatomy images of human brain. From the clinical point of view, this accurate coregistration allows precise detection of nerve fibers that is essential in neuroscience. A template matching algorithm combined with normalized cross-correlation was used for this registration task. To show the suitability of the proposed method, it was compared with the normalized mutual information-based B-spline registration provided by the Elastix software library, considered a reference method. We also propose a general framework for the evaluation of robustness and reliability of both registration methods. Both registration methods were tested by four evaluation criteria on a dataset consisting of 74 healthy subjects. The template matching algorithm has shown more reliable results than the reference method in registration of the MR fractional anisotropy and T1 anatomy image data. Significant differences were observed in the regions splenium of corpus callosum and genu of corpus callosum, considered very important areas of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that, in this registration task, the currently used mutual information-based parametric registration can be replaced by more accurate local template matching utilizing the normalized cross-correlation similarity measure.},

Fortunately, re- cent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence prob- lems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free op- timizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN ar- chitecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or gated) con- nections which allow the current input charac- ter to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character- level language modeling a hierarchical non- parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural net- work application to date.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by functional impairment in the neural elements and circuits underlying cognitive and memory functions. We hypothesized that fornix/hypothalamus deep brain stimulation (DBS) could modulate neurophysiological activity in these pathological circuits and possibly produce clinical benefits.

METHODS: We conducted a phase I trial in 6 patients with mild AD receiving ongoing medication treatment. Patients received continuous stimulation for 12 months. Three main lines of investigation were pursued including: (1) mapping the brain areas whose physiological function was modulated by stimulation using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, (2) assessing whether DBS could correct the regional alterations in cerebral glucose metabolism in AD using positron emission tomography (PET), and 3) measuring the effects of DBS on cognitive function over time using clinical scales and instruments.

RESULTS: DBS drove neural activity in the memory circuit, including the entorhinal, and hippocampal areas and activated the brain's default mode network. PET scans showed an early and striking reversal of the impaired glucose utilization in the temporal and parietal lobes that was maintained after 12 months of continuous stimulation. Evaluation of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale and the Mini Mental State Examination suggested possible improvements and/or slowing in the rate of cognitive decline at 6 and 12 months in some patients. There were no serious adverse events.

INTERPRETATION: There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches for AD. Modulating pathological brain activity in this illness with DBS merits further investigation.},

abstract = {An inherent drawback of the traditional diffusion tensor model is its limited ability to provide detailed information about multidirectional fiber architecture within a voxel. This leads to erroneous fiber tractography results in locations where fiber bundles cross each other. This may lead to the inability to visualize clinically important tracts such as the lateral projections of the corticospinal tract. In this report, we present a deterministic two-tensor eXtended Streamline Tractography (XST) technique, which successfully traces through regions of crossing fibers. We evaluated the method on simulated and in vivo human brain data, comparing the results with the traditional single-tensor and with a probabilistic tractography technique. By tracing the corticospinal tract and correlating with fMRI-determined motor cortex in both healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors, we demonstrate that two-tensor deterministic streamline tractography can accurately identify fiber bundles consistent with anatomy and previously not detected by conventional single-tensor tractography. When compared to the dense connectivity maps generated by probabilistic tractography, the method is computationally efficient and generates discrete geometric pathways that are simple to visualize and clinically useful. Detection of crossing white matter pathways can improve neurosurgical visualization of functionally relevant white matter areas.},

abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

For example, identifying the Meyer's loop portion of the optic radiation (OR) has clinical significance because of the large number of temporal lobe resections. We use diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography (DTI-FT) to identify the most likely pathway between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the calcarine sulcus in sixteen hemispheres of eight healthy volunteers. Quantitative population comparisons between DTI-FT estimates and published postmortem dissections match with a spatial precision of about 1 mm. The OR can be divided into three bundles that are segmented based on the direction of the fibers as they leave the LGN: Meyer's loop, central, and direct. The longitudinal and radial diffusivities of the three bundles do not differ within the measurement noise; there is a small difference in the radial diffusivity between the right and left hemispheres. We find that the anterior tip of Meyer's loop is 28 +/- 3 mm posterior to the temporal pole, and the population range is 1 cm. Hence, it is important to identify the location of this bundle in individual subjects or patients},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate techniques for anatomical and physiological imaging of the intracranial optic nerve (ON), optic chiasm (OC), and optic tract (OT) at 3T with the aim of visualizing axonal damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging was performed on a 3T scanner employing a custom-designed head coil that consisted of a coil array with four coils (30 x 30 cm(2)). Oblique fast spin echo (FSE) images, magnetization transfer (MT)-enhanced 3D gradient-echo (GRE) time-of-flight (TOF) images, and line scan diffusion images (LSDI) were obtained. Full diffusion tensor (DT) analysis was performed, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and fiber direction maps were obtained. RESULTS: FSE anatomic images were obtained with an in-plane resolution of 0.39 x 0.52 mm(2). The in-plane resolution of the MT and LSDI images was 0.78 x 0.78 mm(2). The OC, intracranial ON, and OT can be seen on these images. The dominant fiber orientations in the OC, ON, and OT, as derived from the DT images, are displayed. CONCLUSION: This study shows that by using 3T and a custom-designed, four-channel head coil, it is possible to acquire high-resolution anatomical and physiological images of the OC, ON, and OT. The pilot results presented here pave the way for imaging the anterior visual pathway in patients with MS},

abstract = {The explosive increase of biomedical literature has made information extraction an increasingly important tool for biomedical research. A fundamental task is the recognition of biomedical named entities (NER) such as genes/proteins, diseases, and species. Recently, a domain-independent method based on deep learning and statistical word embeddings, called long short-term memory network-conditional random field (LSTM-CRF), has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art entity-specific NER tools. However, this method is dependent on gold-standard corpora (GSCs) consisting of hand-labeled entities, which tend to be small but highly reliable. An alternative to GSCs are silver-standard corpora (SSCs), which are generated by harmonizing the annotations made by several automatic annotation systems. SSCs typically contain much more noise than GSCs but have the advantage of containing many more training examples. Ideally, these corpora could be combined to achieve the benefits of both, which is an opportunity for transfer learning. In this work, we analyze to what extent transfer learning improves upon state-of-the-art results for biomedical NER. We also attempt to identify the scenarios where transfer learning offers the biggest advantages. We demonstrate that transferring a deep neural network (DNN) trained on a large, noisy SSC to a smaller, but more reliable GSC improves upon state-of-the-art results for biomedical NER. Compared to a state-of-the-art baseline evaluated on 17 GSCs covering four different entity classes, transfer learning results in an average reduction in error of approximately 9{\%}. We found transfer learning to be especially beneficial for target data sets with a small number of labels (approximately 5000 or less).},

abstract = {Using diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), damage to brain intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connections was assessed in 26 sporadic primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) patients compared with 28 sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with similar disability and 35 healthy controls. DT MRI diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing the two motor neuron disease (MND) variants was tested. PLS and ALS patients showed a distributed pattern of abnormalities of the motor system, including the corticospinal tracts and corpus callosum (CC). PLS versus ALS patients showed a more severe damage to the motor CC fibers and subcortical white matter (WM) underlying the primary motor cortices. Both patient groups showed an extra-motor damage, which was more severe in PLS. This did not appear to be driven by longer disease duration in PLS. In PLS patients, damage to the CC mid-body correlated with the severity of upper motor neuron clinical burden. CC fractional anisotropy values had the highest accuracy in distinguishing PLS from controls and ALS. PLS and ALS share an overlapped pattern of WM abnormalities. This underscores that PLS, despite its distinct clinical phenotype and long survival, still lies within the wider MND spectrum. Whether CC diffusivity may be a novel marker to increase confidence in an early diagnostic separation of PLS from ALS still needs to be investigated.

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to investigate the neural correlates of feeling sympathy for someone else (i.e. the affinity, association, or relationship between persons wherein whatever affects one similarly affects the other). While undergoing PET scans, subjects were presented with a series of video-clips showing individuals (who were semi-professional stage actors) telling sad and neutral stories, as if they had personally experienced them. These stories were told with either congruent or incongruent motor expression of emotion (MEE). At the end of each movie, subjects were asked to rate the mood of the communicator and also how likable they found that person. Watching sad stories versus neutral stories was associated with increased activity in emotion processing-related structures, as well as in a set of cortical areas that belong to a "shared representation" network, including the right inferior parietal cortex. Motor expression of emotion, regardless of the narrative content of the stories, resulted in a specific regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increase in the left inferior frontal gyrus. The condition of mismatch between the narrative content of the stories and the motor expression of emotion elicited a significant skin conductance response and strong rCBF increase in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and superior frontal gyrus which are involved in dealing with social conflict. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model of feeling sympathy that relies on both the shared representation and the affective networks. Interestingly, this network was not activated when subjects watched inappropriate social behavior. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of facial pain. PURPOSE: To answer the following questions: 1) In patients with TN, how often does routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) identify a cause? 2) Which features identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic TN (STN; i.e., a structural cause such as a tumor)? 3) Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify patients with neurovascular compression? 4) Which drugs effectively treat classic and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia? 5) When should surgery be offered? 6) Which surgical technique gives the longest pain-free period with the fewest complications and good quality of life? METHODS: Systematic review of the literature by a panel of experts. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15{\%} of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with MS remains uncertain},

abstract = {Cerebral white matter is known to undergo degradation with aging, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is capable of revealing the white matter integrity. We assessed age-related changes of quantitative diffusivity parameters and fiber characteristics within the fornix and the cingulum. Thirty-eight healthy subjects aged 18-88 years were examined at 3 Tesla using a 1.9-mm isotropic DTI sequence. Quantitative fiber tracking was performed for 3D-segmentation of the fornix and the cingulum to determine fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), eigenvalues (lambda1, lambda2, and lambda3), number of fibers (NoF), and mean NoF/voxel (FpV). In the fornix, all diffusivity parameters (FA, MD, and eigenvalues) were moderately correlated with age. Strong and moderate negative correlations for NoF and FpV were found, respectively. In the cingulum, no correlation was observed between FA and age, and only weak correlations for the other quantitative parameters. Differences in correlations between the fornix and the cingulum were significant for all diffusivity parameters and for NoF, but not for FpV. The strongest relative changes per decade of age were found in the fornix: FA -2.1{\%}, MD 4.2{\%}, NoF -10.6{\%}, and FpV -4.6{\%}. Our quantitative 3D fiber tracking approach shows that the cingulum is resistant to aging while the fornix is not.},

The white matter clusters are augmented with expert anatomical labels and stored in a new type of atlas that we call a high-dimensional white matter atlas. We then show how to perform automatic segmentation of tractography from novel subjects by extending the spectral clustering solution, stored in the atlas, using the Nystrom method. We present results regarding the stability of our method and parameter choices. Finally we give results from an atlas creation and automatic segmentation experiment. We demonstrate that our automatic tractography segmentation identifies corresponding white matter regions across hemispheres and across subjects, enabling group comparison of white matter anatomy.},

abstract = {There has been an increase in research interest for brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as an alternate mode of communication and environmental control for the disabled, such as patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke and spinal cord injury. Disabled patients with appropriate physical care and cognitive ability to communicate with their social environment continue to live with a reasonable quality of life over extended periods of time. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique which utilizes light in the near-infrared range (700 to 1000??nm) to determine cerebral oxygenation, blood flow and metabolic status of localized regions of the brain. In this paper, we describe a study conducted to test the feasibility of using multichannel NIRS in the development of a BCI. We used a continuous wave 20-channel NIRS system over the motor cortex of 5 healthy volunteers to measure oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes during left-hand and right-hand motor imagery. We present results of signal analysis indicating that there exist distinct patterns of hemodynamic responses which could be utilized in a pattern classifier towards developing a BCI. We applied two different pattern recognition algorithms separately, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to classify the data offline. SVM classified left-hand imagery from right-hand imagery with an average accuracy of 73{\%} for all volunteers, while HMM performed better with an average accuracy of 89{\%}. Our results indicate potential application of NIRS in the development of BCIs. We also discuss here future extension of our system to develop a word speller application based on a cursor control paradigm incorporating online pattern classification of single-trial NIRS data. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, recent histopathological studies have convincingly shown that grey matter regions are also heavily affected. Grey matter damage starts early in the disease and substantially affects clinico-cognitive functioning. Detection of cortical grey matter lesions by use of standard MRI techniques has proved challenging, and more advanced techniques are needed. At present, the causes of grey matter damage are unclear. We review several exciting new hypotheses on grey matter pathogenesis, including meningeal inflammation as a cause of subpial cortical damage, but also selective vulnerability of neuronal subpopulations, growth factor dysregulation, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial abnormalities, and the "use-it-and-lose-it" principle. These hypotheses remain to be validated over the coming years, and could substantially affect our current views on MS pathogenesis.},

Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669. ±. 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR diffusion tensor imaging permits detailed visualization of white matter fiber tracts. This technique, unlike T2-weighted imaging, also provides information about fiber direction. We present findings of normal white matter fiber tract anatomy at high resolution obtained by using line scan diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS: Diffusion tensor images in axial, coronal, and sagittal sections covering the entire brain volume were obtained with line scan diffusion imaging in six healthy volunteers. Images were acquired for b factors 5 and 1000 s/mm(2) at an imaging resolution of 1.7 x 1.7 x 4 mm. For selected regions, images were obtained at a reduced field of view with a spatial resolution of 0.9 x 0.9 x 3 mm. For each pixel, the direction of maximum diffusivity was computed and used to display the course of white matter fibers. RESULTS: Fiber directions derived from diffusion tensor imaging were consistent with known white matter fiber anatomy. The principal fiber tracts were well observed in all cases. The tracts that were visualized included the following: the arcuate fasciculus; superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus; uncinate fasciculus; cingulum; external and extreme capsule; internal capsule; corona radiata; auditory and optic radiation; anterior commissure; corpus callosum; pyramidal tract; gracile and cuneatus fasciculus; medial longitudinal fasciculus; rubrospinal, tectospinal, central tegmental, and dorsal trigeminothalamic tract; superior, inferior, and middle cerebellar peduncle; pallidonigral and strionigral fibers; and root fibers of the oculomotor and trigeminal nerve. CONCLUSION: We obtained a complete set of detailed white matter fiber anatomy maps of the normal brain by means of line scan diffusion tensor imaging at high resolution. Near large bone structures, line scan produces images with minimal susceptibility artifacts},

Here, we report a method using functional magnetic resonance imaging that evaluates the hippocampal regions in vivo, and we use this method to study elderly with normal memory, with isolated memory decline, and with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although age-related memory decline occurs commonly, the cause of this decline remains unknown, with disagreement as to whether this decline represents one or more etiologies. Analysis revealed two distinct patterns of regional dysfunction among elderly with isolated memory decline--one pattern similar to that found in elders with AD, involving all hippocampal regions, and a second pattern with dysfunction restricted to only one hippocampal region, the subiculum. These results offer direct evidence of hippocampal dysfunction associated with memory decline in the elderly, and implicate both predementia AD and non-AD processes as possible underlying causes.},

abstract = {Anterior temporal lobe resection is often complicated by superior quadrantic visual field deficits (VFDs). In some cases this can be severe enough to prohibit driving, even if a patient is free of seizures. These deficits are caused by damage to Meyer's loop of the optic radiation, which shows considerable heterogeneity in its anterior extent. This structure cannot be distinguished using clinical magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Diffusion tensor tractography is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique that enables the parcellation of white matter. Using seed voxels antero-lateral to the lateral geniculate nucleus, we applied this technique to 20 control subjects, and 21 postoperative patients. All patients had visual fields assessed with Goldmann perimetry at least three months after surgery. We measured the distance from the tip of Meyer's loop to the temporal pole and horn in all subjects. In addition, we measured the size of temporal lobe resection using postoperative T(1)-weighted images, and quantified VFDs. Nine patients suffered VFDs ranging from 22{\%} to 87{\%} of the contralateral superior quadrant. In patients, the range of distance from the tip of Meyer's loop to the temporal pole was 24-43 mm (mean 34 mm), and the range of distance from the tip of Meyer's loop to the temporal horn was -15 to +9 mm (mean 0 mm). In controls the range of distance from the tip of Meyer's loop to the temporal pole was 24-47 mm (mean 35 mm), and the range of distance from the tip of Meyer's loop to the temporal horn was -11 to +9 mm (mean 0 mm). Both quantitative and qualitative results were in accord with recent dissections of cadaveric brains, and analysis of postoperative VFDs and resection volumes. By applying a linear regression analysis we showed that both distance from the tip of Meyer's loop to the temporal pole and the size of resection were significant predictors of the postoperative VFDs. We conclude that there is considerable variation in the anterior extent of Meyer's loop. In view of this, diffusion tensor tractography of the optic radiation is a potentially useful method to assess an individual patient's risk of postoperative VFDs following anterior temporal lobe resection},

abstract = {Life expectancies have increased substantially in the last century, dramatically amplifying the proportion of individuals who will reach old age. As individuals age, cognitive ability declines, although the rate of decline differs amongst the forms of memory domains and for different individuals. Memory domains especially impacted by aging are declarative and spatial memories. The hippocampus facilitates the formation of declarative and spatial memories. Notably, the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to aging. Genetic predisposition and lifetime experiences and exposures contribute to the aging process, brain changes and subsequent cognitive outcomes. In this review, two factors to which an individual is exposed, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, will be considered regarding the impact of age on hippocampal-dependent function. Spatial memory can be affected by cumulative exposure to chronic stress via glucocorticoids, released from the HPA axis, and from gonadal steroids (estrogens, progesterone and androgens) and gonadotrophins, released from the HPG axis. Additionally, this review will discuss how these hormones impact age-related hippocampal function. We hypothesize that lifetime experiences and exposure to these hormones contribute to the cognitive makeup of the aged individual, and contribute to the heterogeneous aged population that includes individuals with cognitive abilities as astute as their younger counterparts, as well as individuals with severe cognitive decline or neurodegenerative disease.},

In patients with neuralgia not responding to medical treatment or transcutaneous ablative procedures, the pain can often be treated successfully by partial rhizotomy of the trigeminal sensory root. We have examined partial trigeminal rhizotomy specimens from six multiple sclerosis patients, aged between 34 and 77 years, with intractable trigeminal neuralgia lasting between 18 months and 11 years. The rhizotomy specimens were placed in buffered glutaraldehyde immediately after resection, and subsequently processed for electron microscopy. In all cases, this revealed demyelination in the proximal (CNS) part of the nerve root, with associated gliosis and variable inflammation. A consistent feature was the presence of clusters of juxtaposed axons without intervening glial processes. Similar juxtaposition of axons was previously observed in trigeminal neuralgia due to vascular compression of the nerve root. Experimental studies indicate that this arrangement of demyelinated axons is conducive to both spontaneous impulse activity and ephaptic spread of excitation. The demyelination and associated juxtaposition of axons may therefore account for key aspects of the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia.},

However, humans are capable of engaging in cognitive tasks while in pain, although it is not known how the brain represents these processes concurrently. There is some evidence for a cortical interaction between pain- and cognitive-related brain activity, but the outcome of this interaction may depend on the relative load imposed by the pain versus the task. Therefore, we used 3 levels of cognitive load (multisource interference task) and 2 levels of pain intensity (median nerve stimulation) to examine how functional magnetic resonance imaging activity in regions identified as pain-related or cognitive-related responds to different combinations of pain intensity and cognitive load. Overall, most pain-related or cognitive-related brain areas showed robust responses with little modulation. However, during the more intense pain, activity in primary sensorimotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex/posterior insula, anterior insula, paracentral lobule, caudal anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum, and supplementary motor area was modestly attenuated by the easy task and in some cases the difficult task. Conversely, cognitive-related activity was not modulated by pain, except when cognitive load was minimal during the control task.

abstract = {Highlights • We reviewed neuroimaging studies of pain syndromes in multiple sclerosis (MS). • All studies investigated neuropathic pain or headache, mainly using structural MRI. • Most reported associations between location of demyelinating lesions and pain. • Culprit lesions were most commonly reported in the brainstem. • High quality hypothesis-driven neuroimaging studies of pain in MS are still needed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Abstract Introduction While pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) is common, in many cases the precise mechanisms are unclear. Neuroimaging studies could have a valuable role in investigating the aetiology of pain syndromes. The aim of this review was to synthesise and appraise the current literature on neuroimaging studies of pain syndromes in MS. Methods We systematically searched PubMed and Scopus from their inception dates to the 2nd of April 2013. Studies were selected by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodological quality was appraised. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. Results We identified 38 studies of variable methodology and quality. All studies but one used conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging, and the majority reported a positive association between location of demyelinating lesions and specific neuropathic pain syndromes. Most investigated headache and facial pain, with more common pain syndromes such as limb pain being relatively understudied. We identified a number of methodological concerns, which along with variable study design and reporting limit our ability to synthesise data. Higher quality studies were however less likely to report positive associations of lesion distribution to pain syndromes. Conclusions Further high quality hypothesis-driven neuroimaging studies of pain syndromes in MS are required to clarify pain mechanisms, particularly for the commonest pain syndromes.},

abstract = {In this clinical and neurophysiological study, we examined the clinical characteristics and underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain related to multiple sclerosis. A total of 302 consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis were screened for neuropathic pain by clinical examination and the DN4 tool. In patients selected for having ongoing extremity pain or Lhermitte's phenomenon, we recorded somatosensory evoked potentials, mediated by Abeta non-nociceptive fibres, and laser evoked potentials, mediated by Adelta nociceptive fibres. Of the 302 patients, 92 had pain (30{\%}), and 42 (14{\%}) neuropathic pain. Patients with neuropathic pain had more severe multiple sclerosis, as assessed by the expanded disability severity score, than those without pain. Whereas, in patients with ongoing neuropathic pain, laser evoked potentials were more frequently abnormal than somatosensory evoked potentials, we found the opposite in patients with Lhermitte's phenomenon. Our data underline the clinical importance of pain in multiple sclerosis and indicate that a more severe disease is associated with a higher risk of developing neuropathic pain. The prevalence of pain that we found, which was lower than that reported in previous studies, may reflect the lesser disease severity in our patients. Neurophysiological data show that whereas ongoing extremity pain is associated with spinothalamic pathway damage, Lhermitte's phenomenon is related to damage of non-nociceptive pathways. These findings may be useful in designing a new therapeutic approach to neuropathic pain related to multiple sclerosis},

However, this typically requires large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we demonstrate that the amount of labeled training data can be drastically reduced when deep learning is combined with active learning. While active learning is sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and word encoders and a long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models. We carry out incremental active learning, during the training process, and are able to nearly match state-of-the-art performance with just 25{\%} of the original training data.},

Since reward processing is closely linked to the ventral striatum and the neurotransmitter dopamine, we examined the relationships between brain gray matter, placebo analgesic response, and personality traits associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission. We report that dopamine-related traits predict a substantial portion of the pain relief an individual gains from a sham treatment. Voxel-based morphometry of magnetic resonance images shows that the magnitude of placebo analgesia is related to gray matter density (GMD) in several brain regions, including the ventral striatum, insula, and prefrontal cortex. Similarly, GMD in ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex is related to dopamine-related personality traits. Our findings highlight the relationship between placebo and reward and potentially offer ways of identifying subjects who are likely to show large placebo analgesic responses},

abstract = {Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic condition that involves significant hyperalgesia of the affected limb, typically accompanied by localized autonomic abnormalities, and frequently motor dysfunction. Although central brain systems are thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of CRPS, these systems have not been well characterized. In this study, we used structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to characterize differences in gray matter volume between patients with right upper extremity CRPS and matched controls . Analyses were carried out using a whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach. The CRPS group showed decreased gray matter volume in several pain-affect regions, including the dorsal insula, left orbitofrontal cortex, and several aspects of the cingulate cortex. Greater gray matter volume in CRPS patients was seen in the bilateral dorsal putamen and right hypothalamus. Correlation analyses with self-reported pain were then performed on the CRPS group. Pain duration was associated with decreased gray matter in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Pain intensity was positively correlated with volume in the left posterior hippocampus and left amygdala, and negatively correlated with the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings demonstrate that CRPS is associated with abnormal brain system morphology, particularly pain-related sensory, affect, motor, and autonomic systems. PERSPECTIVE: This paper presents structural changes in the brains of patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome helping us differentiate CRPS from other chronic pain syndromes and furthering our understanding of this challenging disease.},

At 3 weeks following implantation, lesioned nerves showed areas of focal inflammation surrounding implanted sutures with prominent demyelination of adjacent axons. A total of 497 trigeminal units were studied, 304 of which had associated demyelination of the root.

Reflected orthodromic action potentials and prolonged high-frequency after-discharges following short priming trains of orthodromic stimuli were observed in 23{\%} and 4{\%} of cells, respectively. Ectopic spike initiation from areas of focal demyelination was not dependent upon anatomical continuity of the nerve with the brain stem, was augmented by hyperventilation, and could be eliminated by the intravenous administration of diphenylhydantoin sodium.

More commonly, however, transcutaneous approaches to the foramen ovale are performed. Although complications with this latter technique are uncommon, studies of the distances to the surrounding extracranial vascular structures are lacking in the literature. The present study aimed to elucidate such anatomical relationships. METHODS: Twenty adult cadavers (40 sides) underwent dissection of the region surrounding the foramen ovale at the external skull base. Measurements between the external surface of the foramen ovale and surrounding vascular structures were made. RESULTS: From the nearest aspect of the undersurface of the foramen ovale, the authors found that the mean distances to the middle meningeal artery, maxillary artery, superior bulb of the internal jugular vein, and internal carotid artery at its entrance to and exit from the carotid canal were 3, 19, 20, 9, and 12 mm, respectively. Distances tended to be shorter in females, but this did not reach statistical significance. On the basis of these data, the authors also determined a safe zone while approaching the undersurface of the foramen ovale. CONCLUSIONS: Additional knowledge of the neurovascular relationships surrounding the foramen ovale may be useful to the neurosurgeon and may help decrease the potential for complications},

abstract = {Although single high-dose injections of dop-amine are known to be acutely toxic 3 , surpris-ingly, the gradual increase of dopamine in the TH-RREE model had no effect on substantia nigra neurons in WT mice. However, when the authors injected the TH-RREE construct into mice expressing mutant A53T $\alpha$-synuclein, an autosomal dominant mutation seen in famil-ial Parkinson's disease, there was a substantial loss of neuronal cell bodies in the substantia nigra, along with degeneration of projecting presynaptic terminals in the striatum. This pathology was most prominent 5 months after injection, with degeneration of more than half of the synapses at this timepoint. Moreover, these mice had locomotor impairment, likely related to the nigrostriatal damage. By con-trast, 2.5 months after injection there was mild synaptic damage but no degeneration of cell bodies and no locomotor impairment (Fig. 1), suggesting that the synaptic defects might precede the other pathologic changes in these mice. Collectively, the data suggest that the vulnerability of substantia nigra neurons is related to the collective pathologic interplay of dopamine and $\alpha$-synuclein. Previous studies have suggested that $\alpha$-synuclein oligomers promote the degenera-tion of substantia nigra neurons. To explore mechanisms by which $\alpha$-synuclein and dop-amine might conspire to kill these neurons, the authors looked at $\alpha$-synuclein oligomers in the A53T TH-RREE mice. Studies sug-gest that oxidized dopamine helps stabilize toxic $\alpha$-synuclein oligomers 4 , though the pathophysiological roles of these oligomers remain unclear. The authors found that tissue from the substantia nigra of A53T TH-RREE mice contained several oligomeric $\alpha$-synuclein species, suggesting that the initiation and pro-gression of pathology in these mice might be related to oligomeric $\alpha$-synuclein. Finally, the authors recapitulated the cooperative effect of $\alpha$-synuclein and dopamine in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, showing that the physical inter-action of dopamine and $\alpha$-synuclein is criti-cal to pathogenesis. Specifically, expression of CAT-2, a C. elegans TH homolog expected to increase dopamine levels, also enhanced the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons expressing A53T. Furthermore, mutating the A53T synuclein at residues known to mediate the interaction of $\alpha$-synuclein with dopamine-products (125 YEMPS 129) abro-gated the A53T-induced degeneration, high-lighting the importance of this association in disease pathogenesis. The importance of $\alpha$-synuclein to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is unques-tionable, yet until now there has been no $\alpha$-synuclein mouse model that can robustly recapitulate the loss of substantia nigra neurons—a cardinal feature of the human disease. The authors have now generated such a model, which should be a useful tool for the community. A noteworthy feature of this model is that the $\alpha$-synuclein-induced synaptic degeneration precedes the loss of neuronal cell bodies and locomotor impair-ment. In the physiologic state, $\alpha$-synuclein is highly enriched at presynapses, maintain-ing synaptic homeostasis 5–9 . Thus, several groups, including ours, have suggested that the pathology of $\alpha$-synuclein is initiated at syn-apses, perhaps starting with the aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein here 10–13 . Since oligomeriza-tion of $\alpha$-synuclein seems to be a key feature of the A53T TH-RREE model as well, the early synaptic degeneration in these mice may be induced by $\alpha$-synuclein oligomers, with even-tual degeneration of nigral cell bodies (a 'dying back' consistent with the human neuropathol-ogy). However, the spatial and temporal distri-bution of $\alpha$-synuclein oligomers in the A53T TH-RREE model is as yet unknown. The mechanism by which $\alpha$-synuclein oli-gomers lead to synaptic toxicity and neuronal loss in this mouse model are unclear. Previous studies suggest that $\alpha$-synuclein oligomers can directly impair neurotransmitter release 14 and chaperone-mediated autophagy 15 , but the underlying cell biology is largely unexplored. Most Parkinson's disease is sporadic rather than familial, and it's unclear whether the mechanisms proposed by Mor et al. 1 using the aggregation-prone A53T mutant are generally applicable. Mouse models expressing wild-type $\alpha$-synuclein in the setting of dysregulated dop-amine may shed further light. It is also unclear whether genetic elevation of dopamine levels is truly representative of the pathology seen in human disease. Animal and cellular models that better recapitulate the sporadic pathology are badly needed, not just for Parkinson's but for all neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {The use of functional brain imaging techniques offers the possibility of uncovering the cerebral processing of the human pain experience. In recent years, many imaging studies have focused on defining a network of brain structures involved in the processing of normal pain. Additionally, it has been shown that stimulus-evoked pain, which is a frequent symptom of neuropathic pain, causes distinct patterns of brain activation. In the present study, we quantitatively analyzed the data of previous functional imaging studies. Studies were thus collected by means of a MEDLINE query. A meta-analysis using the activation-likelihood estimation method was conducted to quantify the acquired results. We then used this data to summarize and compare the cerebral activations of (i) normal and stimulus-evoked pain, (ii) thermal and mechanical pain, (iii) different types of stimulus-evoked pain (hyperalgesia, allodynia), and (iv) clinical neuropathic and experimental pain. The results suggest the existence of distinct, although overlapping, neuronal networks related to these different types of pain.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to create a white matter atlas of the human brain using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and to describe the constant and variable features of the major pathways. DTI was acquired from 40 healthy right-handed adults and reconstructed tracts mapped within a common reference space (MNI). Group effect maps of each tract defined constant anatomical features while overlap maps were generated to study inter-subject variability and to compare DTI derived anatomy with a histological atlas. Two patients were studied to assess the localizing validity of the atlas. The DTI-derived maps are overall consistent with a previously published histological atlas. A statistically significant leftward asymmetry was found for the volume and number of streamlines of the cortico-spinal tract and the direct connections between Broca's and Wernicke's territories (long segment). A statistically significant rightward asymmetry was found for the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the fronto-parietal connections (anterior segment) of the arcuate fasciculus. Furthermore, males showed a left lateralization of the fronto-temporal segment of the arcuate fasciculus (long segment), while females had a more bilateral distribution. In two patients with brain lesions, DTI was acquired and tractography used to show that the tracts affected by the lesions were correctly identified by the atlas. This study suggests that DTI-derived maps can be used together with a previous histological atlas to establish the relationship of focal lesions with nearby tracts and improve clinico-anatomical correlation.},

Specifically, we conciliate quantitative studies of microcircuitry and the functional logic of neuronal computations. We revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference-paying careful attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles. This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.},

We investigated gray matter morphometry and white matter anisotropy in CRPS patients and matched controls. Patients exhibited a disrupted relationship between white matter anisotropy and whole-brain gray matter volume; gray matter atrophy in a single cluster encompassing right insula, right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and right nucleus accumbens; and a decrease in fractional anisotropy in the left cingulum-callosal bundle. Reorganization of white matter connectivity in these regions was characterized by branching pattern alterations, as well as increased (VMPFC to insula) and decreased (VMPFC to basal ganglion) connectivity. While regional atrophy differentially related to pain intensity and duration, the strength of connectivity between specific atrophied regions related to anxiety. These abnormalities encompass emotional, autonomic, and pain perception regions, implying that they likely play a critical role in the global clinical picture of CRPS.},

abstract = {OBJECT: The surgical management of disabling tremor has gained renewed vigor with the availability of deep brain stimulation. However, in the face of an aging population of patients with increasing surgical comorbidities, noninvasive approaches for tremor management are needed. The authors' purpose was to study the technique and results of stereotactic radiosurgery performed in the era of MRI targeting. METHODS: The authors evaluated outcomes in 86 patients (mean age 71 years; number of procedures 88) who underwent a unilateral Gamma Knife thalamotomy (GKT) for tremor during a 15-year period that spanned the era of MRI-based target selection (1996-2011). Symptoms were related to essential tremor in 48 patients (19 age ≥ 80 years and 3 age ≥ 90 years), Parkinson disease in 27 patients (11 age ≥ 80 years [1 patient underwent bilateral procedures]), and multiple sclerosis in 11 patients (1 patient underwent bilateral procedures). A single 4-mm isocenter was used to deliver a maximum dose of 140 Gy to the posterior-inferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to grade tremor, handwriting, and ability to drink. The median follow-up was 23 months. RESULTS: The mean tremor score was 3.28 ± 0.79 before and 1.81 ± 1.15 after (p {\textless} 0.0001) GKT; the mean handwriting score was 2.78 ± 0.82 and 1.62 ± 1.04, respectively (p {\textless} 0.0001); and the mean drinking score was 3.14 ± 0.78 and 1.80 ± 1.15, respectively (p {\textless} 0.0001). After GKT, 57 patients (66{\%}) showed improvement in all 3 scores, 11 patients (13{\%}) in 2 scores, and 2 patients (2{\%}) in just 1 score. In 16 patients (19{\%}) there was a failure to improve in any score. Two patients developed a temporary contralateral hemiparesis, 1 patient noted dysphagia, and 1 sustained facial sensory loss. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife thalamotomy in the MRI era was a safe and effective noninvasive surgical strategy for medically refractory tremor in the elderly or those with contraindications to deep brain stimulation or stereotactic radiofrequency (thermal) thalamotomy.},

abstract = {Previous neuroimaging studies have shown brain activity during not only the application of noxious stimuli, but also prior to stimulation. The functional significance of the anticipatory response, however, has yet to be explored. Two theoretical responses involve either a decrease or an increase in sensitivity of the nociceptive system. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, brainstem responses during anticipation and processing of thermal noxious stimuli were investigated. Twelve healthy subjects were warned prior to and then received noxious stimulation to their left hand. Behavioral data showed a positive correlation between the intensity of anticipation and pain. FMRI data revealed brainstem activation in the PAG during the anticipation period. When correlated with individual anticipation ratings, activation during anticipation included significant clusters within the entorhinal cortex and ventral tegmental area (VTA). During receipt, activation within the brainstem included the PAG, VTA, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and the parabrachial nucleus (PB), all elements of descending pain pathways. Using a backward model approach, we explored the functional significance of the anticipatory neural response for subsequent pain processing. Results of this regression analysis revealed that insula activity during receipt was predicted by activity in both the entorhinal cortex and VTA during anticipation. We suggest that activation in both regions before and during pain may underlie anticipation and subsequent pain modulatory responses, possibly involving the appraisal and control of attention necessary for pain modulation. Together, the results suggest a possible role of brainstem areas in anticipatory mechanisms involved in the maintenance of chronic pain.},

The fact that water diffusion is sensitive to the underlying tissue microstructure provides a unique method of assessing the orientation and integrity of these neural fibres, which may be useful in assessing a number of neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of water diffusion and its anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence) with the underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The emphasis of the review will be on model neurological systems both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy and their evaluation will be presented followed by an overview of various studies of restricted diffusion and compartmentation as they relate to anisotropy. Pertinent pathological models, developmental studies and theoretical analyses provide further insight into the basis of anisotropic diffusion and its potential utility in the nervous system.},

abstract = {Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) is a major component of the virion envelope and infected cell membranes and is essential for virus entry into cells. We have recently shown that gD interacts with a limited number of cell surface receptors which are required for virus penetration into cells. To define domains of gD which are required for aspects of virus replication including receptor binding, deletion mutations of 5 to 14 amino acids were constructed by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Plasmids containing mutant genes for gD were assayed for the ability to rescue a recombinant virus, F-gD beta, in which beta-galactosidase sequences replace gD-coding sequences. Effects on global folding and posttranslational processing of the molecules were assessed by using a panel of monoclonal antibodies which recognize both continuous and discontinuous epitopes. A region near the amino terminus (residues 7 to 21) of gD which is recognized by monoclonal antibodies able to neutralize herpes simplex virus in the absence of complement was not essential for function. In addition, virtually all of the cytoplasmic domain of gD and an extracellular domain close to the membrane were dispensable. In contrast, deletion mutations in the central region of the molecule, save for one exception, led to alterations in global folding of the molecule and maturation of the protein was inhibited.},

The significant performance improvement of our model is due to optimization by removing unnecessary modules in conventional residual networks. The performance is further improved by expanding the model size while we stabilize the training procedure. We also propose a new multi-scale deep super-resolution system (MDSR) and training method, which can reconstruct high-resolution images of different upscaling factors in a single model.

These natural products have revealed three members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family--TRPV1, TRPM8, and TRPA1--as molecular detectors of thermal and chemical stimuli that activate sensory neurons to produce acute or persistent pain. Analysis of TRP channel function and expression has validated the existence of nociceptors as a specialized group of somatosensory neurons devoted to the detection of noxious stimuli. These studies are also providing insight into the coding logic of nociception and how specification of nociceptor subtypes underlies behavioral discrimination of noxious thermal, chemical, and mechanical stimuli. Biophysical and pharmacological characterization of these channels has provided the intellectual and technical foundation for developing new classes of analgesic drugs.},

abstract = {Recently published data suggest substantial anatomic, clinical, and physiologic (referred pain to meridian) overlap of myofascial trigger points and acupuncture points, particularly in the treatment of pain disorders. This qualitative study examines whether myofascial referred-pain data from the Trigger Point Manual can provide independent physiologic evidence of acupuncture meridians. Trigger point regions were subdivided from prior, validated trigger point region-classical acupuncture point correspondence results into subsets according to the 12 acupuncture Organs of their anatomically corresponding acupuncture points (Bladder, Gallbladder, Heart, Kidney, Large Intestine, Liver, Lung, Pericardium, Small Intestine, Spleen, Stomach, and Triple Energizer). The referred-pain patterns for each subset of trigger point regions were graphically applied to a virtual human model along with the subset's corresponding acupuncture Principal meridian. All 12 meridian distributions were compared qualitatively with the summed referred-pain distributions of their anatomically corresponding trigger point regions. For all 12 subsets of trigger point regions, their summed referred-pain patterns accurately predicted the distributions of their corresponding acupuncture meridians, particularly in the extremities. The myofascial referred-pain data from the Trigger Point Manual provides independent physiologic evidence of acupuncture meridians. Understanding these meridians may enhance treatment of both pain and non-pain conditions. PERSPECTIVE: This article demonstrates that myofascial referred-pain data provide independent physiologic evidence of acupuncture meridians. The acupuncture tradition provides pain practitioners with millennia of accumulated clinical experience treating pain (and visceral) disorders and offers the potential for novel pain treatment approaches and understanding of pain neurophysiology.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We studied the influence of using plugs for brainstem protection during gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), with special emphasis on irradiation doses delivered to the trigeminal nerve, pain outcomes, and incidence of trigeminal dysfunction. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A GKR procedure for TN using an anterior cisternal target and a maximum dose of 90 Gy was performed in 109 patients. For 49 patients, customized beam channel blocking (plugs) were used to reduce the dose delivered to the brainstem. We measured the mean and integrated radiation doses delivered to the trigeminal nerve and the clinical course of patients treated with and without plugs. RESULTS: We found that blocking increases the length of trigeminal nerve exposed to high-dose radiation, resulting in a significantly higher mean dose to the trigeminal nerve. Significantly more of the patients with blocking achieved excellent pain outcomes (84{\%} vs. 62{\%}), but with higher incidences of moderate and bothersome trigeminal nerve dysfunction (37{\%} mild/10{\%} bothersome with plugs vs. 30{\%} mild/2{\%} bothersome without). CONCLUSIONS: The use of plugs to protect the brainstem during GKR treatment for TN increases the dose of irradiation delivered to the intracisternal trigeminal nerve root and is associated with an important increase in the incidence of trigeminal nerve dysfunction. Therefore, beam channel blocking should be avoided for 90 Gy-GKR of TN},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gamma knife radiosurgery is an alternative for the treatment of medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia. Few reports of posttreatment MR imaging appearance of cranial nerve V exist. Our purpose was to define MR imaging characteristics in cranial nerve V after gamma knife radiosurgery. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR images of 15 patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia. Radiation doses were 35-45 Gy at the 50{\%} isodose line. Thin-section T2-weighted images and contrast-enhanced and nonenhanced T1-weighted images were obtained the day of radiosurgery and within the next 5 mo. Images were scored for enhancement and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. Time to follow-up imaging and radiation dose were recorded. RESULTS: Mean time to follow-up imaging was 61 +/- 29 d. Posttreatment T2-weighted images showed stable signal intensity in all cases, with radiosurgical target site enhancement in 10. All five patients whose images did not show treatment-related enhancement received radiation doses of 35 Gy. The data suggested a correlation between enhancement with radiation dose (P =.06). No correlation of enhancement with treatment response or time to follow-up existed (P {\textgreater}.05). CONCLUSION: The trigeminal nerve often enhances at the target site after radiosurgery. Lack of trigeminal nerve enhancement occurred only with lower doses (35 Gy at 50{\%}). MR imaging may be useful to confirm the presence and location of the treatment site after gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Partial volume with CSF is known to contaminate the quantification of white matter anisotropy depicted by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We hypothesized that the FLAIR technique helps to improve DTI white matter tractography in the normal adult brain by eliminating CSF partial volume effects. METHODS: Seven healthy adults aged 23-37 underwent both conventional and FLAIR DTI at 1.5T. Each subject was imaged five times. Neural fiber tractography was performed with both sequences by using two algorithms: a voxel-based method (EZ-tracing) with global seed points and another based on subvoxel tractography (tensor deflection) by using manual encircling of local seed points. Total volume of the fibers tracked was compared for the two types of images. RESULTS: Fiber tracking was substantially most successful on FLAIR DTI near the lateral ventricles and the sulci, where CSF partial volume effects were likely present. Minor false tracts on FLAIR images, possibly due to a reduced signal-to-noise ratio, were found in regions relatively free of CSF contamination; however, they did not affect tracking of major periventricular white matter bundles, such as those related to the corpus callosum or the corona radiata. When we excluded false tracts, the FLAIR technique depicted an average of 17{\%} more fibers in volume than conventional DTI in the periventricular regions (P {\textless} .0005, paired Student t test). CONCLUSION: Despite the reduction of signal-to-noise ratio and longer imaging times, FLAIR improved tractography by eliminating CSF partial volume effects},

abstract = {The startle reflex is elicited by intense tactile, acoustic or vestibular stimuli. Fast mechanoreceptors in each modality can respond to skin or head displacement. In each modality, stimulation of cranial nerves or primary sensory nuclei evokes startle-like responses. The most sensitive sites in rats are found in the ventral spinal trigeminal pathway, corresponding to inputs from the dorsal face. Cross-modal summation is stronger than intramodal temporal summation, suggesting that the convergence of acoustic, vestibular and tactile information is important for eliciting startle. This summation declines sharply if the cross-modal stimuli are not synchronous. Head impact stimuli activate trigeminal, acoustic and vestibular systems together, suggesting that the startle response protects the body from impact stimuli. In each primary sensory nucleus, large, second-order neurons project to pontine reticular formation giant neurons critical for the acoustic startle reflex. In vestibular nucleus sites, startle-like responses appear to be mediated mainly via the vestibulospinal tract, not the reticulospinal tract. Summation between vestibulospinal and reticulospinal pathways mediating startle is proposed to occur in the ventral spinal cord.},

abstract = {The optic chiasm with its complex fiber micro-structure is a challenge for diffusion tensor models and tractography methods. Likewise, it is an ideal candidate for evaluation of diffusion tensor imaging tractography approaches in resolving inter-regional connectivity because the macroscopic connectivity of the optic chiasm is well known. Here, high-resolution (156 microm in-plane) diffusion tensor imaging of the human optic chiasm was performed ex vivo at ultra-high field (9.4 T). Estimated diffusion tensors at this high resolution were able to capture complex fiber configurations such as sharp curves, and convergence and divergence of tracts, but were unable to resolve directions at sites of crossing fibers. Despite the complex microstructure of the fiber paths through the optic chiasm, all known connections could be tracked by a line propagation algorithm. However, fibers crossing from the optic nerve to the contralateral tract were heavily underrepresented, whereas ipsilateral nerve-to-tract connections, as well as tract-to-tract connections, were overrepresented, and erroneous nerve-to-nerve connections were tracked. The effects of spatial resolution and the varying degrees of partial volume averaging of complex fiber architecture on the performance of these methods could be investigated. Errors made by the tractography algorithm at high resolution were shown to increase at lower resolutions closer to those used in vivo. This study shows that increases in resolution, made possible by higher field strengths, improve the accuracy of DTI-based tractography. More generally, post-mortem investigation of fixed tissue samples with diffusion imaging at high field strengths is important in the evaluation of MR-based diffusion models and tractography algorithms.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) has been widely used to investigate brain microstructural changes in pathological conditions as well as for normal development and aging. In particular, longitudinal changes are vital to the understanding of progression but these studies are typically designed for specific regions of interest. To analyze changes in these regions traditional statistical methods are often employed to elucidate group differences which are measured against the variability found in a control cohort. However, in some cases, rather than collecting multiple subjects into two groups, it is necessary and more informative to analyze the data for individual subjects. There is also a need for understanding changes in a single subject without prior information regarding the spatial distribution of the pathology, but no formal statistical framework exists for these voxel-wise analyses of DTI. In this study, we present PERVADE (permutation voxel-wise analysis of diffusion estimates), a whole brain analysis method for detecting localized FA changes between two separate points in time of any given subject, without any prior hypothesis about where changes might occur. Exploiting the nature of DTI that it is calculated from multiple diffusion-weighted images of each region, permutation testing, a non-parametric hypothesis testing technique, was modified for the analysis of serial DTI data and implemented for voxel-wise hypothesis tests of diffusion metric changes, as well as for suprathreshold cluster analysis to correct for multiple comparisons. We describe PERVADE in detail and present results from Monte Carlo simulation supporting the validity of the technique as well as illustrative examples from a healthy subject and patients in the early stages of multiple sclerosis},

abstract = {Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in five countries and three continents, which is still growing.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can detect structural changes in normal-appearing white matter, and to distinguish between plaques of different pathologic severity, in patients with MS. BACKGROUND: Conventional MRI detects lesions sensitively in MS but has limited pathologic specificity. The diffusion of water molecules in brain tissue, most fully expressed mathematically by a tensor quantity, reflects its intrinsic microstructure. It is now possible to estimate the diffusion tensor noninvasively in the human brain using MR DTI. This method is unique in providing precise and rotationally invariant measurements of the amount and directional bias (anisotropy) of diffusion in white matter tracts relating to tissue integrity and orientation. METHODS: DTI was performed in six patients with MS and in six age-matched control subjects. Diffusion was characterized in normal-appearing white matter in both groups, and in lesions of different pathologic subtypes (inflammatory, noninflammatory, T1 hypointense, and T1 isointense). RESULTS: DTI identified significantly altered water diffusion properties in the normal-appearing white matter of patients compared with control subjects (p {\textless} 0.001), and distinguished between lesion types. The highest diffusion was seen in destructive (T1 hypointense) lesions, whereas the greatest change in anisotropy was found in inflammatory (gadolinium-enhancing) lesions. CONCLUSIONS: DTI detects diffuse abnormalities in the normal-appearing white matter of MS patients, and the findings in lesions appear to relate to pathologic severity. Its use in serial studies and in larger clinical cohorts may increase our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of reversible and persistent disability.},

METHODS: Using diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) to investigate white matter damage, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to look at its underlying pathologic basis, the authors investigated the relationship between white matter structure and cognition in 106 healthy middle-aged and elderly adults. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values, whole brain white matter histograms, and regions of interest placed in the white matter of the centrum semiovale were analyzed. Correlations with executive function, working memory, and information-processing speed were performed. RESULTS: There was a progressive reduction in FA and increase in diffusivity with age in both region of interest (r = 0.551, p {\textless} 0.001), and whole brain histograms (r = 0.625, p {\textless} 0.001). DTI values correlated with performance in all three cognitive domains. After controlling for age, DTI parameters correlated with working memory but not with the other two cognitive domains. MRS studies found a correlation of N-acetyl aspartate, a neuronal marker, with DTI parameters (r = 0.253, p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with white matter damage due to axonal loss, causing age- related cognitive decline. Working memory may be particularly dependent on complex networks dependent on white matter connections},

By using optogenetic functionalmagnetic resonance imaging to locallymanipulate but globally visualize neural activity in rats,we found that dopamine neuron stimulation drives striatal activity, whereas locally increased mPFC excitability reduces this striatal response and inhibits the behavioral drive for dopaminergic stimulation. This chronicmPFC overactivity also stably suppresses natural reward-motivated behaviors and induces specific new brainwide functional interactions, which predict the degree of anhedonia in individuals.These findings describe amechanism by which mPFC modulates expression of reward-seeking behavior, by regulating the dynamical interactions between specific distant subcortical regions.

abstract = {OBJECT: Recent progress in the understanding of abnormal electrical behavior in injured sensory neurons motivated an examination, at the ultrastructural level, of trigeminal roots of patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). METHODS: In 12 patients biopsy specimens of trigeminal root were obtained during surgery for microvascular decompression. Pathological changes in tissue included axonopathy and axonal loss, demyelination, a range of less severe myelin abnormalities (dysmyelination), residual myelin debris, and the presence of excess collagen, including condensed collagen masses in two cases. Within zones of demyelination, groups of axons were often closely apposed without an intervening glial process. Pathological characteristics of nerve fibers were clearly graded with the degrees of root compression noted at operation. Pain also occurred, however, in some patients who did not appear to have a severe compressive injury. CONCLUSIONS: Findings were consistent with the ignition hypothesis of TN. This model can be used to explain the major positive and negative symptoms of TN by axonopathy-induced changes in the electrical excitability of afferent axons in the trigeminal root and of neuronal somata in the trigeminal ganglion. The key pathophysiological changes include ectopic impulse discharge, spontaneous and triggered afterdischarge, and crossexcitation among neighboring afferents},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Compared with conventional T2-weighted MR imaging, diffusion tensor MR imaging provides quantitative indices with increased specificity to the most destructive aspects of multiple sclerosis. In this study, we obtained brain mean diffusivity ({\_}D) and fractional anisotropy histograms of patients with multiple sclerosis to compare them with those of healthy volunteers and to investigate the correlation between diffusion tensor MR imaging histogram-derived measures and the level of disability and quantities derived from conventional MR imaging.

METHODS: Dual-echo and diffusion tensor MR images were obtained from 78 patients with relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, or primary progressive multiple sclerosis and from 20 healthy control volunteers. After obtaining mean diffusivity ({\_}D) and fractional anisotropy images and image coregistration, {\_}D and fractional anisotropy histograms were created. From each histogram, the following measures were derived: the average {\_}D and fractional anisotropy, the histogram peak heights, and the histogram peak locations.

RESULTS: All the {\_}D and fractional anisotropy histogram-derived measures were different between patients and controls at a significance level of P {\textless}.001. No differences were found in any of the considered quantities among the three multiple sclerosis phenotypes. In patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, disability was correlated with histogram average{\_}D (r = 0.4, P =.01) and peak height (r = -0.4, P =.01). In patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, disability was correlated with fractional anisotropy histogram peak position (r = -0.6, P =.01). Significant correlations were also found between T2 lesion load and various diffusion tensor MR quantities.

CONCLUSION: This study shows that brain {\_}D and fractional anisotropy histograms are different for patients with multiple sclerosis compared with control volunteers. This study also shows that quantities derived from diffusion tensor MR imaging are correlated with disability in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, suggesting that they might serve as additional measures of outcome when monitoring multiple sclerosis evolution in these patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data with very high isotropic resolution can be obtained at 7T. However, for extensive brain coverage, a large number of slices is required, resulting in long acquisition times (TAs). Recording multiple slices simultaneously (SMS) promises to reduce the TA.

METHODS: A combination of zoomed and parallel imaging is used to achieve high isotropic resolution dMRI data with a low level of distortions at 7T. The blipped-CAIPI (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) approach is used to acquire several slices simultaneously. Due to their high radiofrequency (RF) power deposition and ensuing specific absorption rate (SAR) constraints, the commonly used multiband (MB) RF pulses for SMS imaging are inefficient at 7T and entail long repetition times, counteracting the usefulness of SMS acquisitions. To address this issue, low SAR multislice Power Independent of Number of Slices RF pulses are employed.

RESULTS: In vivo dMRI results with and without SMS acceleration are presented at different isotropic spatial resolutions at ultra high field strength. The datasets are recorded at a high angular resolution to detect fiber crossings.

CONCLUSION: From the results and compared with earlier studies at these resolutions, it can be seen that scan time is significantly reduced, while image quality is preserved. Magn Reson Med, 2013. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

METHODS: The CN:VII-VIII as well as inner ear structures in 48 volunteers were examined using 3D-CISS and 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences respectively, and displayed to the full at the reformatted and maximum intensity projection (MIP) images. The nerve identification and image quality were graded for the CN:VII-VIII as well as inner ear structures. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxin test, p{\textless}0.05 was considered significant. In addition, 8 patients with abnormality in facial or vestibulocochlear nerves were also examined using 3D-CISS sequence. RESULTS: The identification rates for the cisternal segment of facial, vestibulocochlear nerves and corresponding membranous labyrinth were 100{\%}. Abnormal changes of the facial or vestibulocochlear nerves were clearly shown in 8 patients, among them 1 was caused by bilateral acoustic neurinoma, 1 by cholesteatoma at cerebellopontine angle, 1 by arachnoid cyst, 1 by neurovascular adhesion, 4 by neurovascular compression. CONCLUSION: With 3D-CISS sequence the fine structure of the CN:VII-VIII and corresponding membranous labyrinth can be clearly demonstrated; lesions at the site of cerebellopontine angle can also be found easily},

The authors began use of this technique at our center in 1992 and have evaluated outcomes serially. Independently acquired data from 220 patients with idiopathic TN that had Gamma Knife radiosurgery was reviewed. The median radiosurgery dose was 80 Gy with a range of 60 to 90 Gy. Most patients had features of typical TN, although 16 (7.3{\%}) described additional atypical features. One hundred thirty-five patients (61.4{\%}) had prior surgery. Patients were followed to a maximum of 6.5 years (median, 2 years). Complete or partial pain relief was achieved in 85.6{\%} of patients at 1 year. Complete pain relief was achieved in 64.9 {\%} of patients at 6 months, 70.3{\%} at 1 year, and 75.4{\%} patients at 33 months. Patients with an atypical pain component had a lower rate of achieving pain relief ( p = 0.025). Due to recurrences, 55.8{\%} of patients had complete or partial pain relief at 5 years. The absence of preoperative sensory disturbance or prior surgery correlated with an increased proportion of patients in complete or partial pain relief over time. Ten percent of patients developed new or increased subjective facial paresthesia or facial numbness. Radiosurgery for idiopathic TN was safe and effective, and provided benefit to a patient population with a high frequency of prior surgical intervention. It is an important addition to the surgical armamentarium for TN},

Second, we intro-duce a Multiple Instance Learning approach to explicitly accommodate global translation and scaling when training a DCNN exclusively with class labels. For this we rely on a 'patchwork' data structure that efficiently lays out all im-age scales and positions as candidates to a DCNN. Fac-toring global and local deformations allows a DCNN to 'focus its resources' on the treatment of non-rigid defor-mations and yields a substantial classification accuracy im-provement. Third, further pursuing this idea, we develop an efficient DCNN sliding window object detector that em-ploys explicit search over position, scale, and aspect ratio.

abstract = {Chronic pain appears to be associated with brain gray matter reduction in areas ascribable to the transmission of pain. The morphological processes underlying these structural changes, probably following functional reorganisation and central plasticity in the brain, remain unclear. The pain in hip osteoarthritis is one of the few chronic pain syndromes which are principally curable. We investigated 20 patients with chronic pain due to unilateral coxarthrosis (mean age 63.25±9.46 (SD) years, 10 female) before hip joint endoprosthetic surgery (pain state) and monitored brain structural changes up to 1 year after surgery: 6-8 weeks, 12-18 weeks and 10-14 month when completely pain free. Patients with chronic pain due to unilateral coxarthrosis had significantly less gray matter compared to controls in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insular cortex and operculum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex. These regions function as multi-integrative structures during the experience and the anticipation of pain. When the patients were pain free after recovery from endoprosthetic surgery, a gray matter increase in nearly the same areas was found. We also found a progressive increase of brain gray matter in the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area (SMA). We conclude that gray matter abnormalities in chronic pain are not the cause, but secondary to the disease and are at least in part due to changes in motor function and bodily integration.},

Two complementary measures, fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), were considered and analysed using voxel-based morphometry. Declarative memory functions were also investigated and their associations with DTI data were analysed. FA was significantly reduced, and the ADC increased in the left sub-gyral white matter of the temporal lobe, which involves the posterior part of the fornix. In the schizophrenic group, females had lower FA than males in the genu of the corpus callosum. Memory functions correlate with FA values. These data provide further evidence for the disruption of white matter connectivity in the left medial temporal lobe, and for its contribution to the declarative memory deficit in schizophrenia.},

AI and ACC activation correlated with individual empathy scores. Activity in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, the sensorimotor cortex (SI/MI), and the caudal ACC was specific to receiving pain. Thus, a neural response in AI and rostral ACC, activated in common for "self" and "other" conditions, suggests that the neural substrate for empathic experience does not involve the entire "pain matrix."

All 3D T2-TSE studies were performed with a 1.5 T MR system. Imaging parameters used for 3DT2-TSE sequence were TR:4000, TE:150, and 0.70 mm slice thickness. A field of view of 160 mm and 256 x 256 matrix were used. The double rootlets of the abducens nerve and contralateral abducens nerves and their relationships with anatomical structures were searched in the subarachnoid space. RESULTS: We identified 540 of 570 abducens nerves (94.7{\%}) in its complete cisternal course with certainty. Seventy-two cases (25.2{\%}) in the present study had double rootlets of the abducens nerve. In 59 of these cases (34 on the right side and 25 on the left) presented with unilateral double rootlets of the abducens. Thirteen cases presented with bilateral double rootlets of the abducens (4.5{\%}). CONCLUSION: An abducens nerve arising by two separate rootlets is not a rare variation. The detection of this anatomical variation by preoperative MR imaging is important to avoid partial damage of the nerve during surgical procedures. The 3DT2-TSE as a noninvasive technique makes it possible to obtain extremely high-quality images of microstructures as cranial nerves and surrounding vessels in the cerebellopontine cistern. Therefore, preoperative MR imaging should be performed to detect anatomical variations of abducens nerve and to reduce the chance of operative injuries},

abstract = {Animals detect environmental changes through sensory neural mechanisms that enable them to differentiate the quality, intensity and temporal characteristics of stimuli. The 'doctrine of specific nervous energies' postulates that the different sensory modalities experienced by humans result of the activation of specific nervous pathways. Identification of functional classes of sensory receptors provided scientific support to the concept that somatosensory modalities (touch, pain, temperature, kinesthesis) are subserved by separate populations of sensory receptor neurons specialized in detecting innocuous and injurious stimuli of different quality (mechanical forces, temperature, chemical compounds). The identification of receptor proteins activated by different physicochemical stimuli, in particular ion channels of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) superfamily, has put forward the concept that specificity of peripheral sensory receptor neurons is determined by their expression of a particular "molecular sensor" that confers to each functional type its selectivity to respond with a discharge of nerve impulses to stimuli of a given quality. Nonetheless, recent experimental data suggest that the various molecular sensors proposed as specific transducer molecules for stimuli of different quality are not as neatly associated with the distinct functional types of sensory receptors as originally proposed. First, many ion channel molecules initially associated to the transduction of only one particular form of energy are also activated by stimuli of different quality, implying a limited degree of specificity in their transducing capacities. Second, molecular sensors associated with a stimulus quality and hence to a sensory receptor type and ultimately to a sensory modality may be concomitantly expressed in sensory receptor neurons functionally defined as specific for another stimulus quality. Finally, activation of voltage gated channels involved primarily in nerve impulse generation can also influence the gating of transducing channels, dramatically modifying their activation profile. Thus, we propose that the capacity exhibited by the different functional types of somatosensory receptor neurons to preferentially detect and encode specific stimuli into a discharge of nerve impulses, appears to result of a characteristic combinatorial expression of different ion channels in each neuronal type that finally determines their transduction and impulse firing properties. Transduction channels don't operate in isolation and their cellular context should also be taken into consideration to fully understand their function. Moreover, the inhomogeneous distribution of transduction and voltage-gated channels at soma, axonal branches and peripheral endings of primary sensory neurons influences the characteristics of the propagated impulse discharge that encodes the properties of the stimulus. Alteration of this concerted operation of ion channels in pathological conditions may underlie the changes in excitability accompanying peripheral sensory neuron injuries.},

Modern concepts of perception—which include computational modeling to quantify the influence of cognitive processes—suggest that perception is critically determined by expectations and their modification through learning.

abstract = {Persistent pain is a sequela of several neurological conditions with a primary immune basis, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, diverse forms of injury to the peripheral or the central nervous systems--whether traumatic, metabolic, or toxic--result in substantial recruitment and activation of immune cells. This response involves the innate immune system, but evidence also exists of T-lymphocyte recruitment, and in some patient cohorts antibodies to neuronal antigens have been reported. Mediators released by immune cells, such as cytokines, sensitise nociceptive signalling in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Preclinical data suggest an immune pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, but clinical evidence of a central role of the immune system is less clear. An important challenge for the future is to establish to what extent this immune response initiates or maintains neuropathic pain in patients and thus whether it is amenable to therapy},

abstract = {The characterization of the topological architecture of complex networks underlying the structural and functional organization of the brain is a basic challenge in neuroscience. However, direct evidence for anatomical connectivity networks in the human brain remains scarce. Here, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging deterministic tractography to construct a macroscale anatomical network capturing the underlying common connectivity pattern of human cerebral cortex in a large sample of subjects (80 young adults) and further quantitatively analyzed its topological properties with graph theoretical approaches. The cerebral cortex was divided into 78 cortical regions, each representing a network node, and 2 cortical regions were considered connected if the probability of fiber connections exceeded a statistical criterion. The topological parameters of the established cortical network (binarized) resemble that of a "small-world" architecture characterized by an exponentially truncated power-law distribution. These characteristics imply high resilience to localized damage. Furthermore, this cortical network was characterized by major hub regions in association cortices that were connected by bridge connections following long-range white matter pathways. Our results are compatible with previous structural and functional brain networks studies and provide insight into the organizational principles of human brain anatomical networks that underlie functional states.},

SF was also obtained from the knee joints of 6 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with mild osteoarthritis, and 26 patients with severe osteoarthritis, in which the grading was evaluated radiographically. The cell component in the SF was cultured for analyses. Synovium (SYN) and bone marrow (BM) were also harvested during total knee arthroplasties.

The MSC number in the SF was hardly noticed in normal volunteers, but it increased in accordance with the grading of osteoarthritis. Though no significant differences were observed regarding surface epitopes, or differentiation potentials, the morphology and gene profiles in SF MSCs were more similar to those in SYN MSCs than in BM MSCs. We listed 20 genes which were expressed higher in both SYN MSCs and SF MSCs than in BM MSCs, and 3 genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: For quick and stable identification of the primary motor area (PMA), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired and corticospinal tractography was mathematically visualized. METHODS: Data sets of DTI, anatomic magnetic resonance imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging with finger-tapping tasks were acquired during the same investigation in 30 patients with a brain lesion affecting the motor system. Off-line processing of DTI data was performed to visualize the corticospinal tract, placing a seed area in the cerebral peduncle of the midbrain, where the corticospinal tract is densely concentrated. Somatosensory evoked magnetic fields and intraoperative cortical somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded with electrical stimulation of the median nerve to confirm the results of the corticospinal tractography. RESULTS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging and somatosensory evoked magnetic fields failed to identify the PMA in eight patients (16.7{\%}) and one patient (3.8{\%}) investigated, respectively, because of cortical dysfunctions caused by brain lesions. DTI data were acquired within 3 minutes without patient tasks. Using the appropriate seed area and fractional anisotropy, corticospinal tractography successfully indicated the PMA location in all patients. The suspected PMA and central sulcus locations were confirmed by the cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. CONCLUSION: Corticospinal tractography enables identification of the PMA and is beneficial, particularly for patients who present with dysfunction of the PMA},

abstract = {PURPOSE Focal radiosurgery is a common treatment modality for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), a neuropathic facial pain condition. Assessment of treatment effectiveness is primarily clinical, given the paucity of investigational tools to assess trigeminal nerve changes. Since diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides information on white matter microstructure, we explored the feasibility of trigeminal nerve tractography and assessment of DTI parameters to study microstructural changes after treatment. We hypothesized that trigeminal tractography provides more information than 2D-MR imaging, allowing detection of unique, focal changes in the target area after radiosurgery. Changes in specific diffusivities may provide insight into the mechanism of action of radiosurgery on the trigeminal nerve. METHODS AND MATERIALS Five TN patients (4 females, 1 male, average age 67 years) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, 80 Gy/100{\%} isodose line underwent 3Tesla MR trigeminal nerve tractography before and sequentially up to fourteen months after treatment. Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial (RD) and axial (AD) diffusivities were calculated for the radiosurgical target area defined as the region-of-interest. Areas outside target and the contralateral nerve served as controls. RESULTS Trigeminal tractography accurately detected the radiosurgical target. Radiosurgery resulted in 47{\%} drop in FA values at the target with no significant change in FA outside the target, demonstrating highly focal changes after treatment. RD but not AD changed markedly, suggesting that radiosurgery primarily affects myelin. Tractography was more sensitive than conventional gadolinium-enhanced post-treatment MR, since FA changes were detected regardless of trigeminal nerve enhancement. In subjects with long term follow-up, recovery of FA/RD correlated with pain recurrence. CONCLUSIONS DTI parameters accurately detect the effects of focal radiosurgery on the trigeminal nerve, serving as an in vivo imaging tool to study TN. This study is a proof of principle for further assessment of DTI parameters to understand the pathophysiology of TN and treatment effects.},

We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a "phoneme." Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0{\%} error on the full test set.

abstract = {We compared brain activations in response to acute noxious thermal stimuli in controls and chronic back pain (CBP) patients. Pain perception and related cortical activation patterns were similar in the two groups. However, nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity differentiated the groups at a very high accuracy, exhibiting phasic and tonic responses with distinct properties. Positive phasic NAc activations at stimulus onset and offset tracked stimulus salience and, in normal subjects, predicted reward (pain relief) magnitude at stimulus offset. In CBP, NAc activity correlated with different cortical circuitry from that of normals and phasic activity at stimulus offset was negative in polarity, suggesting that the acute pain relieves the ongoing back pain. The relieving effect was confirmed in a separate psychophysical study in CBP. Therefore, in contrast to somatosensory pathways, which reflect sensory properties of acute noxious stimuli, NAc activity in humans encodes its predicted value and anticipates its analgesic potential on chronic pain.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Preservation of cranial nerves (CN) is of paramount concern in the treatment of vestibular schwannomas (VS), particularly in large tumors with thinned and distorted CN fibers. However, imaging of the CN fibers surrounding VS has been limited using 2D imaging alone. OBJECTIVE:: We assessed whether tractography of the CN combined with anatomical MR imaging of the tumor can provide superior 3D visualization of tumor/CN complexes. METHODS:: 3T MR imaging including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and anatomical images were analyzed in three subjects with VS using 3D Slicer software. The DTI images were used to tract the courses of trigeminal, abducens, facial, and vestibulocochlear nerves. The anatomical images were used to model the 3D volume reconstruction of the tumor. The two sets of images were then superimposed using linear registration. RESULTS:: Combined 3D tumor modelling and cranial nerve tractography can effectively and consistently reconstruct the 3D spatial relationship of CN/tumor complexes, and allows for superior visualization compared with 2D imaging. Lateral and superior distortion of the trigeminal nerve was observed in all cases. The position of the facial nerve was primarily anteriorly and inferiorly. The Gasserian ganglion and early postganglionic branches could also be visualized. CONCLUSION:: Tractography and anatomical imaging were successfully combined to demonstrate the precise location of surrounding CN fibers. This technique can be useful in both neuronavigation and radiosurgical planning. Since knowledge of the course of these fibers is of important clinical interest, implementation of this technique may help decrease injury to cranial nerves during treatment of these lesions.},

abstract = {Brain responses to pain, assessed through positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are reviewed. Functional activation of brain regions are thought to be reflected by increases in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in PET studies, and in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in fMRI. rCBF increases to noxious stimuli are almost constantly observed in second somatic (SII) and insular regions, and in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and with slightly less consistency in the contralateral thalamus and the primary somatic area (SI). Activation of the lateral thalamus, SI, SII and insula are thought to be related to the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain processing. SI is activated in roughly half of the studies, and the probability of obtaining SI activation appears related to the total amount of body surface stimulated (spatial summation) and probably also by temporal summation and attention to the stimulus. In a number of studies, the thalamic response was bilateral, probably reflecting generalised arousal in reaction to pain. ACC does not seem to be involved in coding stimulus intensity or location but appears to participate in both the affective and attentional concomitants of pain sensation, as well as in response selection. ACC subdivisions activated by painful stimuli partially overlap those activated in orienting and target detection tasks, but are distinct from those activated in tests involving sustained attention (Stroop, etc.). In addition to ACC, increased blood flow in the posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices is thought to reflect attentional and memory networks activated by noxious stimulation. Less noted but frequent activation concerns motor-related areas such as the striatum, cerebellum and supplementary motor area, as well as regions involved in pain control such as the periaqueductal grey. In patients, chronic spontaneous pain is associated with decreased resting rCBF in contralateral thalamus, which may be reverted by analgesic procedures. Abnormal pain evoked by innocuous stimuli (allodynia) has been associated with amplification of the thalamic, insular and SII responses, concomitant to a paradoxical CBF decrease in ACC. It is argued that imaging studies of allodynia should be encouraged in order to understand central reorganisations leading to abnormal cortical pain processing. A number of brain areas activated by acute pain, particularly the thalamus and anterior cingulate, also show increases in rCBF during analgesic procedures. Taken together, these data suggest that hemodynamic responses to pain reflect simultaneously the sensory, cognitive and affective dimensions of pain, and that the same structure may both respond to pain and participate in pain control. The precise biochemical nature of these mechanisms remains to be investigated},

abstract = {Previous functional imaging studies have shown key roles of the dorsal anterior insula (dAI) and anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) in empathy for the suffering of others. The current study mapped structural covariance networks of these regions and assessed the relationship between networks and individual differences in empathic responding in 94 females. Individual differences in empathy were assessed through average state measures in response to a video task showing others' suffering, and through questionnaire-based trait measures of empathic concern. Overall, covariance patterns indicated that dAI and aMCC are principal hubs within prefrontal, temporolimbic, and midline structural covariance networks. Importantly, participants with high empathy state ratings showed increased covariance of dAI, but not aMCC, to prefrontal and limbic brain regions. This relationship was specific for empathy and could not be explained by individual differences in negative affect ratings. Regarding questionnaire-based empathic trait measures, we observed a similar, albeit weaker modulation of dAI covariance, confirming the robustness of our findings. Our analysis, thus, provides novel evidence for a specific contribution of frontolimbic structural covariance networks to individual differences in social emotions beyond negative affect.},

abstract = {Linear registration and motion correction are important components of structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a key investigation technique in modern neuroscience. In clinical settings, diffusion-weighted imaging and its extension to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are usually performed applying the technique of echo-planar imaging (EPI). EPI is the commonly available ultrafast acquisition technique for single-shot acquisition with spatial encoding in a Cartesian system. A drawback of these sequences is their high sensitivity against small perturbations of the magnetic field, caused, e.g., by differences in magnetic susceptibility of soft tissue, bone and air. The resulting magnetic field inhomogeneities thus cause geometrical distortions and intensity modulations in diffusion-weighted images. This complicates the fusion with anatomical T1- or T2-weighted MR images obtained with conventional spin- or gradient-echo images and negligible distortion. In order to limit the degradation of diffusion-weighted MR data, we present here a variational approach based on a reference scan pair with reversed polarity of the phase- and frequency-encoding gradients and hence reversed distortion. The key novelty is a tailored nonlinear regularization functional to obtain smooth and diffeomorphic transformations. We incorporate the physical distortion model into a variational image registration framework and derive an accurate and fast correction algorithm. We evaluate the applicability of our approach to distorted DTI brain scans of six healthy volunteers. For all datasets, the automatic correction algorithm considerably reduced the image degradation. We show that, after correction, fusion with T1- or T2-weighted images can be obtained by a simple rigid registration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the improvement due to the novel regularization scheme. Most importantly, we show that it provides meaningful, i.e. diffeomorphic, geometric transformations, independent of the actual choice of the regularization parameters.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate whether neurological symptoms related to a specific axonal fiber tract in brain white matter were associated with a higher degree of tissue damage in that region, in patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis. To this end, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to segment and evaluate the fiber bundle of interest was implemented, taking care to circumvent the problems caused by pathology. Diffusion tensor (DT) MRI tractography was used to construct, from healthy volunteer data, a probability map for the pyramidal tract (PYT), and this map was applied to patients to calculate DT-derived metrics inside the PYT. In CIS patients with clinical symptoms related to motor function, the DT-derived mean diffusivity and the lesion volume in the PYT were found to be increased, while the fractional anisotropy was no different, when compared to those patients without motor symptoms. These results may be explained by several microstructural changes in the damaged tissue, such as changes in the permeability of axonal cell membranes, decreases of axonal density and edema. The approach taken to analyze a specific fiber tract was possible because the axons in the tract have a high orientational coherence, allowing tissue structure changes to be isolated from the tissue architecture. Its extension to other white matter fiber bundles is therefore limited to bundles with high orientational coherence},

A radiosurgical maximum dose of 70 Gy was delivered to the trigeminal nerve root adjacent to the pons via a 4-mm collimator helmet in 51 patients who presented with trigeminal neuralgia unrelated to tumors. In these patients, the root was localized by stereotactic MRI. Follow-up assessment of pain relief was accomplished by a third party not involved in the patients' clinical care. Within a latency period of 1 day to 4 months following the treatment, 38 of 51 patients (74.5{\%}) were completely free of pain and eventually all medications were tapered off. An additional seven patients (13.7{\%}) experienced reductions in pain from 50 to 90{\%} and utilized little or no medications. Patients who had no prior surgical intervention fared much better than those who had previous surgery to relieve their facial pains. At last follow-up, a mean of 16.3 months (range 6-36 months) after treatment, 41 patients (80.4{\%}) remained pain-free or had marked pain reduction. There were four patients with recurrent pain. All 26 patients with classical symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia with no atypical features who had no prior surgery, had complete or nearly complete pain relief, and none of these patients had recurrent pain. Nine patients with trigeminal neuralgia due to tumors received standard radiosurgical treatment directed at their tumors, and eight of nine (88.8{\%}) had pain relief. Of the total of 60 patients treated for trigeminal neuralgia, 49 (81.7{\%}) experienced complete or nearly complete relief of pain at last follow-up. Only one patient with pre-existing facial sensory loss due to a tumor had a mild increase in facial numbness. No other patient experienced either loss of facial sensation or any other complication.

Although the short-term risks are minimal, the long-term risks of radiation-induced de novo secondary neoplasms or malignant progression of the primary benign tumor need to be considered. There are currently 19 reported cases of tumors linked with stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery, to which we add our second institutional experience of a patient who succumbed to a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) after stereotactic radiotherapy for an acoustic neuroma (AN). Review of these 20 cases revealed 10 de novo secondary tumors, of which eight were malignant, with six being malignant gliomas. The majority of the cases (14 of 20) involved AN, with most being in patients with neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2; 8 of 14), reflecting the large numbers and long-term use of radiotherapy for AN. Accelerated growth of the primary benign AN, some 2 to 6 years after focused radiotherapy, was found in six of eight NF2 patients, with pathological verification of a malignant nerve sheath tumor documented in most. The exact carcinogenic risk after radiotherapy is unknown but likely extremely low. However, the risk is not zero and requires discussion with the patient, with specific consideration in young patients and those with a cancer predisposition.},

So far, few mechanism-based treatments for phantom-limb pain have been proposed. Most published reports are based on anecdotal evidence. Interventions targeting central changes seem promising. The prevention of phantom-limb pain by peripheral analgesia has not yielded consistent results.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To detect diffusion abnormalities in the trigeminal nerves of patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) caused by neurovascular compression (NVC) by using a high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (HR-DTI) technique. METHODS: Thirteen patients with TN and 14 healthy controls underwent HR-DTI scanning. After extracting the trigeminal nerve using a tractography technique, we measured the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and compared the contralateral ratios (CR) of these parameters between the patients and controls, and correlated these ratios with the cross-sectional areas of the nerves. RESULTS: The CRs of the FA values for the trigeminal nerves of the patients (1.00+/-0.15) had significantly higher variance than those of healthy controls (1.00+/-0.05) (P{\textless}.05) and showed a positive correlation with the cross-sectional area of the nerves (r=0.81). In contrast, the CRs of the ADC values were not significantly different between the two groups (1.02+/-0.10 and 1.01+/-0.08, respectively) and had no significant correlation with cross-sectional area. CONCLUSION: HR-DTI can detect an alteration in the relative FA values of affected trigeminal nerves and a correlation with atrophic changes in patients with NVC-induced TN},

abstract = {Patients with Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) frequently exhibit cognitive disorders chronically. Radiologic recognition of DAI can help understand the clinical syndrome and to make treatment decisions. However, CT and conventional MRI are often normal or demonstrate lesions that are poorly related to the cognitive disorders. Recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tractography has been shown to be useful in detecting various types of white matter damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using DTI fiber tractography to detect lesions in DAI patients, and to correlate the DAI lesions with the cognitive disorders. We investigated two patients with chronic DAI. Both had impaired intelligence, as well as attention and memory disorders that restricted their activities of daily living. In both patients, DTI fiber tractography revealed interruption of the white matter fibers in the corpus collosum and the fornix, while no lesions were found on conventional MRI. The interruption of the fornix which involves the circuit of Papez potentially correlates with the memory disorder. Therefore, DTI fiber tractography may be a useful technique for the evaluation of DAI patients with cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {A 53-year old woman with tic doloureaux, affecting her right maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (V2), could elicit shooting pains by slightly tapping her teeth when off medication. The pains, which she normally rated as {\textgreater} 6/10 on a visual analog scale (VAS), were electric shock-like in nature. She had no other spontaneous or ongoing background pain affecting the region. Based on her ability to elicit these tics, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed while she produced brief shocks every 2 minutes on cue (evoked pain) over a 20 min period. In addition, she had 1-2 spontaneous shocks manifested between these evoked pains over the course of functional image acquisition. Increased fMRI activation for both evoked and spontaneous tics was observed throughout cortical and subcortical structures commonly observed in experimental pain studies with healthy subjects; including the primary somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate, and thalamus. Spontaneous tics produced more decrease in signals in a number of regions including the posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, suggesting that regions known to be involved in expectation/anticipation may have been activated for the evoked, but not spontaneous, tics. In this patient there were large increases in activation observed in the frontal regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex and the basal ganglia. Spontaneous tics showed increased activation in classic aversion circuitry that may contribute to increased levels of anxiety. We believe that this is the first report of functional imaging of brain changes in tic-doloureaux},

abstract = {Intracranial neurostimulation for pain relief is most frequently delivered by stimulating the motor cortex, the sensory thalamus, or the periaqueductal and periventricular gray matter. The stimulation of these sites through MCS (motor cortex stimulation) and DBS (deep brain stimulation) has proven effective for treating a number of neuropathic and nociceptive pain states that are not responsive or amenable to other therapies or types of neurostimulation. Prospective randomized clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of these intracranial therapies have not been published. Intracranial neurostimulation is somewhat different than other forms of neurostimulation in that its current primary application is for the treatment of medically intractable movement disorders. However, the increasing use of intracranial neurostimulation for the treatment of chronic pain, especially for pain not responsive to other neuromodulation techniques, reflects the efficacy and relative safety of these intracranial procedures. First employed in 1954, intracranial neurostimulation represents one of the earliest uses of neurostimulation to treat chronic pain that is refractory to medical therapy. Currently, 2 kinds of intracranial neurostimulation are commonly used to control pain: motor cortex stimulation and deep brain stimulation. MCS has shown particular promise in the treatment of trigeminal neuropathic pain and central pain syndromes such as thalamic pain syndrome. DBS may be employed for a number of nociceptive and neuropathic pain states, including cluster headaches, chronic low back pain, failed back surgery syndrome, peripheral neuropathic pain, facial deafferentation pain, and pain that is secondary to brachial plexus avulsion. The unique lack of stimulation-induced perceptual experience with MCS makes MCS uniquely suited for blinded studies of its effectiveness. This article will review the scientific rationale, indications, surgical techniques, and outcomes of intracranial neuromodulation procedures for the treatment of chronic pain},

abstract = {We propose a dual pathway, 11-layers deep, three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for the challenging task of brain lesion segmentation. The devised architecture is the result of an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current networks proposed for similar applications. To overcome the computational burden of processing 3D medical scans, we have developed an efficient and effective dense training scheme which automatically adapts to the inherent class imbalance present in the data. The training makes use of the notion of image segments which joins multiple patches from the same image into one pass through the network. Further, we analyze the development of deeper, thus more discriminative 3D CNNs. In order to incorporate both local and larger contextual information, we employ a dual pathway architecture that processes the input images at multiple scales simultaneously. For post-processing of the network's soft segmentation, we use a 3D fully connected Conditional Random Field which effectively removes false positives. Our pipeline is extensively evaluated on three challenging tasks of lesion segmentation in multi-channel MRI patient data with traumatic brain injuries, brain tumors, and ischemic stroke. We improve on the state-of-the-art for all three applications, with top ranking performance on the public benchmarks BRATS 2015 and ISLES 2015. Our method is computationally efficient and achieves a segmentation of a brain scan in less than six minutes. The source code of our implementation is made publicly available.},

@article{Smith2006a,
abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

abstract = {Anatomical and physiological studies in animals, as well as functional imaging studies in humans have shown that multiple cortical areas are activated by painful stimuli. The view that pain is perceived only as a result of thalamic processing has, therefore, been abandoned, and has been replaced by the question of what functions can be assigned to individual cortical areas. The following cortical areas have been shown to be involved in the processing of painful stimuli: primary somatosensory cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex and its vicinity in the parietal operculum, insula, anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex. These areas probably process different aspects of pain in parallel. Previous psychophysical research has emphasized the importance of separating pain experience into sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational components. The sensory-discriminative component of pain can be considered a sensory modality similar to vision or olfaction; it becomes more and more evident that it is subserved by its own apparatus up to the cortical level. The affective-motivational component is close to what may be considered 'suffering from pain'; it is clearly related to aspects of emotion, arousal and the programming of behaviour. This dichotomy, however, has turned out to be too simple to explain the functional significance of nociceptive cortical networks. Recent progress in imaging technology has, therefore, provided a new impetus to study the multiple dimensions of pain.},

abstract = {Most of the research devoted to BMI development consists of methodological studies comparing different online mathematical algorithms, ranging from simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (Dornhege et al., 2007) to nonlinear artificial neural networks (ANNs) or support vector machine (SVM) classification. Single cell spiking for the reconstruction of hand movements requires different statistical solutions than electroencephalography (EEG)-rhythm classification for communication. In general, the algorithm for BMI applications is computationally simple and differences in classification accuracy between algorithms used for a particular purpose are small. Only a very limited number of clinical studies with neurological patients are available, most of them single case studies. The clinical target populations for BMI-treatment consist primarily of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and severe CNS damage including spinal cord injuries and stroke resulting in substantial deficits in communication and motor function. However, an extensive body of literature started in the 1970s using neurofeedback training. Such training implemented to control various EEG-measures provided solid evidence of positive effects in patients with otherwise pharmacologically intractable epilepsy, attention deficit disorder, and hyperactivity ADHD. More recently, the successful introduction and testing of real-time fMRI and a NIRS-BMI opened an exciting field of interest in patients with psychopathological conditions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Cartilage fragments and MSCs were wrapped into fibrin glue; and the constructs were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Histological analysis showed neocartilage-like structure with positive Alcian blue staining in the cartilage fragment-fibrin-MSC constructs. However, constructs with only MSCs in fibrin showed condensed appearance like MSCs in the pellet culture. Gene expression of type II collagen in the constructs with 60 mg cartilage fragments were significantly elevated after 4 weeks of implantation. Conversely, the constructs without cartilage fragments failed to express type II collagen, which indicated MSCs did not differentiate into a chondrogenic lineage. In conclusion, we demonstrated the effect of cartilage fragments from osteoarthritic knee in promoting chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. This may be a favorable strategy for MSC chondrogenesis without exogenous growth factor induction.},

Further analysis also shows that the superiority of the proposed model can be largely attributed to the use of the nested attention mechanism, which has proven particularly effective in correcting local errors that involve small edits in orthography.},

abstract = {To understand factors that affect brain connectivity and integrity, it is beneficial to automatically cluster white matter (WM) fibers into anatomically recognizable tracts. Whole brain tractography, based on diffusion-weighted MRI, generates vast sets of fibers throughout the brain; clustering them into consistent and recognizable bundles can be difficult as there are wide individual variations in the trajectory and shape of WM pathways. Here we introduce a novel automated tract clustering algorithm based on label fusion - a concept from traditional intensity-based segmentation. Streamline tractography generates many incorrect fibers, so our top-down approach extracts tracts consistent with known anatomy, by mapping multiple hand-labeled atlases into a new dataset. We fuse clustering results from different atlases, using a mean distance fusion scheme. We reliably extracted the major tracts from 105-gradient high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI) of 198 young normal twins. To compute population statistics, we use a pointwise correspondence method to match, compare, and average WM tracts across subjects. We illustrate our method in a genetic study of white matter tract heritability in twins. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Some cognitive disturbances accompanying schizophrenia may be due to abnormalities in the thalamus and components of the limbic system. The fornix is an important white-matter relay pathway connecting these structures and is likely to be affected in schizophrenia as well.Magnetic resonance images of the fornix were analyzed in 15 schizophrenic patients and 15 matched comparison group subjects. Fornix volume was compared between the two groups and was also correlated with the volumes of other neuroanatomical structures, as well as with illness presentation, clinical status, and cognitive/psychological measures. There was no significant difference in fornix volume between the two groups. Of note, fornix volume correlated significantly with the volumes of the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and the superior temporal gyrus in the schizophrenic subjects, but not in the controls. Moreover, the correlation between fornix and parahippocampal gyrus volumes differed significantly between the two groups. No association was found between fornix volume and illness presentation or between fornix and cognitive/clinical measures.Results suggest that there are no marked changes in fornix volume in schizophrenia by MRI. The fornix, however, may be part of a network of structures affected in schizophrenia, as indicated by correlated volumetric changes.},

abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Structure of the brain is generally thought to remain stationary over the course of young adulthood. However, there is some evidence that microstructural changes of the brain do occur during this period. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides quantitative measures of structural changes in the brain. We used DTI to detect possible age-related structural changes in the brains of young adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five healthy adults in their 20s and 30s were studied using DTI. Maps of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were created for subsequent histogram and region-of-interest analyses, and the results were correlated with the respective ages of the subjects. RESULTS: The histogram analysis revealed a significant increase in the mean FA value (r = 0.407, P {\textless} .05) and a significant decrease in FA peak height (r = -0.578, P {\textless} .002) with increasing age. No age-related changes were observed in indices derived from mean diffusivity maps. Region-of-interest analysis showed no focal white matter regions with significant FA change. CONCLUSION: Quantitative DTI revealed age-related structural changes in the brains of young adults. Changes on FA histograms observed in this study were considered to be related to changes in the relative volumes of gray and white matter and may represent maturational changes},

In this study relating fornix volume with memory, we made magnetic resonance imaging-based volume estimates of 13 brain structures in 38 individuals with surgically removed colloid cysts. Fornix status was assessed directly by overall volume and indirectly by mammillary body volume (which atrophies after fornix damage). Mammillary body volume significantly correlated with 13 out of 14 tests of episodic memory recall, but correlated poorly with recognition memory. Furthermore, as the volumes of the left fornix and the left mammillary bodies decreased, the difference between recall and recognition scores increased. No other structure was consistently associated with memory. These findings support models of diencephalic memory mechanisms that require hippocampal inputs for recall, but not for key elements of recognition.},

abstract = {In this study, we systematically investigated fiber demography, based on function and distribution, from the periphery to their destinations in the various central (sub) nuclei in the trigeminal brainstem nuclear sensory complex. Conventional and novel compelling information is provided, demonstrating that the ratio and somatotopy of types A and C sensory fibers at the site of a lesion can elucidate important puzzles in TNP disorders. For instance, we explain how of a major shift in the fibers' direction and ratio at the level of the trigeminal root entry zone (REZ) influences the pathophysiology of pre- and typical trigeminal neuralgia. As a result, there is a high A/C ratio of oral and peri-oral fibers in the supero-medial region of the REZ, which is mostly susceptible to vascular compression. However, this A/C ratio varies considerably at lower proportions in other areas along the peripheral trigeminal pathway, where an injury (viral, vessel compression, or trauma) can lead to a broader spectrum of fiber involvement and, consequently, pain outcome. In summary, we explain how fiber demography can influence pain quality, location, temporal features, progress, and treatment prognosis of TNP in those patients who develop it},

We have recorded local field potentials (LFP) from macroelectrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of 14 patients with Parkinson's disease following surgical treatment with deep brain stimulation. Patients were studied in the 'Off' medication state and in the 'On' motor state after administration of levodopa-carbidopa (po) or apomorphine (sc) that elicited dyskinesias in 11 patients. The logarithm of the power spectrum of the LFP in selected frequency bands (4-10, 11-30 and 60-80 Hz) was compared between the 'Off' and 'On' medication states. A peak in the 11-30 Hz band was recorded in the 'Off' medication state and reduced by 45.2{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001) in the 'On' state. The 'On' was also associated with an increment of 77. 6{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001) in the 4-10 Hz band in all patients who showed dyskinesias and of 17.8{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001) in the 60-80 Hz band in the majority of patients. When dyskinesias were only present in one limb (n = 2), the 4-10 Hz peak was only recorded in the contralateral STN. These findings suggest that the 4-10 Hz oscillation is associated with the expression of LID in Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {Dopamine neurons located in the midbrain play a role in motivation that regulates approach behavior (approach motivation). In addition, activation and inactivation of dopamine neurons regulate mood and induce reward and aversion, respectively. Accumulating evidence suggests that such motivational role of dopamine neurons is not limited to those located in the ventral tegmental area, but also in the substantia nigra. The present paper reviews previous rodent work concerning dopamine's role in approach motivation and the connectivity of dopamine neurons, and proposes two working models: One concerns the relationship between extracellular dopamine concentration and approach motivation. High, moderate and low concentrations of extracellular dopamine induce euphoric, seeking and aversive states, respectively. The other concerns circuit loops involving the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, epithalamus, and midbrain through which dopaminergic activity alters approach motivation. These models should help to generate hypothesis-driven research and provide insights for understanding altered states associated with drugs of abuse and affective disorders.},

We analyzed high-speed cin{\'{e}} films of goldfish C-starts elicited by dropping a ball into the water. It was previously thought that stage 1 angle does not vary concomitantly with the angle of the threatening stimulus relative to the position of the fish. We found, however, a significant inverse relationship between the direction of the impact of the ball and the angle turned by the end of stage 1. When starting near a wall, or when its usual trajectory was blocked by a wall, the fish used an escape route that was not predictable from the stimulus angle. The fish did not appear to correct its trajectory if it began to turn towards the ball. This behavioral evidence supports the previous notion that the underlying neural command is ballistic and does not use sensory information from the stimulus once the movement begins. If this is so, the fish probably utilizes information on obstacle location in the interval leading up to the trigger stimulus.},

abstract = {A multidiffusion-tensor model (MDT) is presented containing two anisotropic and one isotropic diffusion tensors. This approach has the ability to detect areas of fiber crossings and resolve the direction of crossing fibers. The mean diffusivity and the ratio of the tensor compartments were merged to one independent parameter by fitting MDT to the diffusion-weighted intensities of a two-point data acquisition scheme. By an F-test between the errors of the standard single diffusion tensor and the more complex MDT, fiber crossings were detected and the more accurate model was chosen voxel by voxel. The performance of crossing detection was compared with the spherical harmonics approach in simulations as well as in vivo. Similar results were found in both methods. The MDT model, however, did not only detect crossings but also yielded the single fiber directions. The FACT algorithm and a probabilistic connectivity algorithm were extended to support the MDT model. For example, a mean angular error smaller than 10 degrees was found for the MDT model in a simulated fiber crossing with an SNR of 80. By tracking the corticospinal tract the MDT-based tracks reached a significantly greater area of the gyrus precentralis.},

The similarity between these two patterns of midline cortical activation may reflect a common neural system for explicit and default-mode self-reference, but there is little direct evidence about the similarities and differences between the neural systems that mediate explicit self-reference versus default-mode self-reference during rest. In two experiments, we compared directly the brain regions activated by explicit self-reference during judgments about trait adjectives and by rest conditions relative to a semantic task without self-reference. Explicit self-reference preferentially engaged dorsal MPFC, rest preferentially engaged precuneus, and both self-reference and rest commonly engaged ventral MPFC and PCC. These findings indicate that there are both associations (shared components) and dissociations between the neural systems underlying explicit self-reference and the default mode of brain function.},

abstract = {Evolutionarily older brain systems, such as the limbic system, appear to serve fundamental aspects of emotional processing and provide relevant and motivational information for phylogenetically more recent brain systems to regulate complex behaviors. Overall, overt behavior is, in part, determined by the interactions of multiple learning and memory systems, some seemingly complementary and some actually competitive. An understanding of limbic system function in emotion and motivation requires that these subsystems be recognized and characterized as extended components of a distributed limbic network. Behavioral neuroscientists face the challenge of teasing apart the contributions of multiple overlapping neuronal systems in order to begin to elucidate the neural mechanisms of the limbic system and their contributions to behavior. One major consideration is to bring together conceptually the functions of individual components of the limbic forebrain and the related limbic midbrain systems. For example, in the rat the heterogeneous regions of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., prelimbic, anterior cingulate, subgenual cortices and orbito-frontal areas) make distinct contributions to emotional and motivational influences on behavior and each needs consideration in its own right. Major interacting structures of the limbic system include the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdaloid nuclear complex, limbic thalamus, hippocampal formation, nucleus accumbens (limbic striatum), anterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area and midbrain raphe nuclei; the latter comprising largely serotonergic components of the limbic midbrain system projecting to the forebrain. The posterior limbic midbrain complex comprising the stria medullaris, central gray and dorsal and ventral nuclei of Gudden are also key elements in the limbic midbrain. Some of these formations will be discussed in terms of the neurochemical connectivity between them. We put forward a systems approach in order to build a network model of the limbic forebrain/limbic midbrain system, and the interactions of its major components. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that the limbic system is both an anatomical entity as well as a physiological concept. We have considered this issue in detail in the introduction to this review. The components of these systems have usually been considered as functional units or 'centers' rather than being components of a larger, interacting, and distributed functional system. In that context, we are oriented toward considerations of distributed neural systems themselves as functional entities in the brain.},

abstract = {We have developed a method for automated probabilistic reconstruction of a set of major white-matter pathways from diffusion-weighted MR images. Our method is called TRACULA (TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy) and utilizes prior information on the anatomy of the pathways from a set of training subjects. By incorporating this prior knowledge in the reconstruction procedure, our method obviates the need for manual interaction with the tract solutions at a later stage and thus facilitates the application of tractography to large studies. In this paper we illustrate the application of the method on data from a schizophrenia study and investigate whether the inclusion of both patients and healthy subjects in the training set affects our ability to reconstruct the pathways reliably. We show that, since our method does not constrain the exact spatial location or shape of the pathways but only their trajectory relative to the surrounding anatomical structures, a set a of healthy training subjects can be used to reconstruct the pathways accurately in patients as well as in controls.},

abstract = {What is the difference between pain and standard exteroceptive perceptual processes, such as vision or audition? According to the most common view, pain constitutes the internal perception of bodily damage. Following on from this definition, pain is just like exteroceptive perception, with the only difference being that it is not oriented toward publicly available objects, but rather toward events that are taking place in/to one's own body. Many theorists, however, have stressed that pain should not be seen as a kind of perception, but rather that it should be seen as a kind of affection or motivation to act instead. Though pain undeniably has a discriminatory aspect, what makes it special is its affective-motivational quality of hurting. In this article, we discuss the relation between pain and perception, at both the conceptual and empirical levels. We first review the ways in which the perception of internal damage differs from the perception of external objects. We then turn to the question of how the affective-motivational dimension of pain is different from the affective-motivational aspects that are present for other perceptual processes. We discuss how these differences between pain and exteroceptive perception can account for the fact that the experience of pain is more subjective than other perceptual experiences. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Previous brain imaging studies have shown robust activations in the insula during nociceptive stimulation. Most activations involve the posterior insular cortex but they can cover all insular gyri in some fMRI studies. However, little is known about the timing of activations across the different insular sub-regions. We report on the distribution of intracerebrally recorded nociceptive laser evoked potentials (LEPs) acquired from the full extent of the insula in 44 epileptic patients. Our study shows that both posterior and anterior subdivisions of the insular cortex respond to a nociceptive heat stimulus within a 200-400 ms latency range. This nociceptive cortical potential occurs firstly, and is larger, in the posterior granular insular cortex. The presence of phase reversals in LEP components in both posterior and anterior insular regions suggests activation of distinct, presumably functionally separate, sources in the posterior and anterior parts of the insula. Our results suggest that nociceptive input is first processed in the posterior insula, where it is known to be coded in terms of intensity and anatomical location, and then conveyed to the anterior insula, where the emotional reaction to pain is elaborated.},

It has often been viewed as a type of mental disorder or has been assumed to stem from pathological alterations in the region of the amputation stump. In the past decade, evidence has accumulated that phantom pain might be a phenomenon of the CNS that is related to plastic changes at several levels of the neuraxis and especially the cortex. Here, we discuss the evidence for putative pathophysiological mechanisms with an emphasis on central, and in particular cortical, changes.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a practical protocol for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the human optic nerve with echo planar imaging (EPI) geometric distortion correction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A conventional DTI protocol was modified to acquire images with fat and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suppression and field inhomogeneity maps of contiguous coronal slices covering the whole brain. The technique was applied to healthy volunteers and multiple sclerosis patients with and without a history of unilateral optic neuritis. DTI measures and optic nerve tractography before and after geometric distortion correction were compared. Diffusion measures from left and right or from affected and unaffected eyes in different subject cohorts were reported. RESULTS: The image geometry after correction closely resembled reference anatomical images. Optic nerve tractography became feasible after distortion correction. The diffusion measures from the healthy volunteers were in good agreement with the literature. Statistically significant differences were found in the fractional anisotropy and orthogonal eigenvalues between affected and unaffected eyes in optic neuritis patients with poor recovery. The diffusion measures before and after geometric distortion correction were not significantly different. For cohorts without optic neuritis, the difference between diffusion measures from left and right eyes was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The proposed technique could provide a practical DTI protocol to study the human optic nerve. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2009;30:699-707. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recently, in a post-mortem and a subsequent structural MR study, a significantly increased gyrification index (GI) was demonstrated in the frontal lobe in individuals with schizophrenia. To examine whether frontal lobe hypergyria is region-specific and whether this might be a suitable endophenotype in the search for the genetic basis of schizophrenia, the frontal as well as parieto-occipital GI were determined in MRI scans of families affected with schizophrenia. METHOD: In the MRI scans of 48 subjects suffering from schizophrenia, in 82 of their first-degree relatives and in 41 control subjects, the GI was determined in three sections anterior to the genu of the corpus callosum and three sections posterior to the splenium, thus allowing for a selective determination of this measure in the frontal as well as the parietal lobe. Outer and inner contours constituting the GI was determined in each section by manual tracing. Statistical analysis was performed using MANOVA with factors diagnostic group and intervening factors from preliminary analyses. RESULTS: The frontal, but not parieto-occipital GI was significantly higher in schizophrenic patients as well as unaffected relatives compared with control subjects (right: 7{\%}, F=13.24, df=3, 155, p{\textless}0.0005, left: 6{\%}, F=8.92, df=3, 155, p{\textless}0.0005). There was no overall difference between affected and unaffected family members. On the left side however, there was a significant interaction between diagnostic group and genetic loading (F=4.68, df=2, 101, p=0.01): significantly higher GI was found in affected compared with unaffected family members only in uniaffected and not multiaffected families. CONCLUSIONS: These results support our primary finding of hypergyria in the frontal lobe in schizophrenic patients. Compared to the parietal lobe, hypergyria seems to affect the frontal lobe selectively and serves as a suitable neurodevelopmental, possibly even an endophenotypic marker},

abstract = {We examined in vivo evidence of axonal degeneration in association with neuronal pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through analysis of fornix microstructural integrity and measures of hippocampal subfield atrophy. Based on known anatomical topography, we hypothesized that the local thickness of subiculum and CA1 hippocampus fields would be associated with fornix integrity, reflecting an association between AD-related injury to hippocampal neurons and degeneration of associated axon fibers. To test this hypothesis, multi-modal imaging, combining measures of local hippocampal radii with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), was applied to 44 individuals clinically diagnosed with AD, 44 individuals clinically diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 96 cognitively normal individuals. Fornix microstructural degradation, as measured by reduced DTI-based fractional anisotropy (FA), was prominent in both MCI and AD, and was associated with reduced hippocampal volumes. Further, reduced fornix FA was associated with reduced anterior CA1 and antero-medial subiculum thickness. Finally, while both lesser fornix FA and lesser hippocampal volume were associated with lesser episodic memory, only the hippocampal measures were significant predictors of episodic memory in models including both hippocampal and fornix predictors. The region-specific association between fornix integrity and hippocampal neuronal death may provide in vivo evidence for degenerative white matter injury in AD: axonal pathology that is closely linked to neuronal injury.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Readout-segmented echo-planar imaging (rs-EPI) can provide high quality diffusion data because it is less prone to distortion and blurring artifacts than single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI), particularly at higher resolution and higher field. Readout segmentation allows shorter echo-spacing and echo train duration, resulting in reduced image distortion and blurring, respectively, in the phase-encoding direction. However, these benefits come at the expense of longer scan times because the segments are acquired in multiple repetitions times (TRs). This study shortened rs-EPI scan times by reducing the TR duration with simultaneous multislice acceleration.

METHODS: The blipped-CAIPI method for slice acceleration with reduced g-factor SNR loss was incorporated into the diffusion-weighted rs-EPI sequence. The rs- and ss-EPI sequences were compared at a range of resolutions at both 3 and 7 Tesla in terms of image fidelity and diffusion postprocessing results.

RESULTS: Slice-accelerated clinically useful trace-weighted images and tractography results are presented. Tractography analysis showed that the reduced artifacts in rs-EPI allowed better discrimination of tracts than ss-EPI.

CONCLUSION: Slice acceleration reduces rs-EPI scan times providing a practical alternative to diffusion-weighted ss-EPI with reduced distortion and high resolution. Magn Reson Med, 2014. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Peripheral cannabinoid 2 receptors (CB2 receptors) modulate immune responses and attenuate nociceptive behaviour in models of acute and persistent pain. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether peripheral CB2 receptors modulate spinal processing of innocuous and noxious responses and to determine whether there are altered roles of CB2 receptors in models of persistent pain. Effects of local administration of the CB2 receptor agonist JWH-133 (5 and 15 microg/50 microL) on mechanically evoked responses of spinal wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in noninflamed rats, rats with carrageenan-induced hindpaw inflammation, sham operated rats and spinal nerve-ligated (SNL) rats were determined in anaesthetized rats in vivo. Mechanical stimulation (von Frey filaments, 6-80 g) of the peripheral receptive field evoked firing of WDR neurons. Mechanically evoked responses of WDR neurons were similar in noninflamed, carrageenan-inflamed, sham-operated and SNL rats. Intraplantar injection of JWH-133 (15 microg), but not vehicle, significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) inhibited innocuous and noxious mechanically evoked responses of WDR neurons in all four groups of rats. In many cases the selective CB2 receptor antagonist, SR144528 (10 microg/50 microL), attenuated the inhibitory effects of JWH-133 (15 microg) on mechanically evoked WDR neuronal responses. The CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716A, did not attenuate the inhibitory effects of JWH-133 on these responses. Intraplantar preadministration of JWH-133 also inhibited (P {\textless} 0.05) carrageenan-induced expansion of peripheral receptive fields of WDR dorsal horn neurons. This study demonstrates that activation of peripheral CB2 receptors attenuates both innocuous- and noxious-evoked responses of WDR neurons in models of acute, inflammatory and neuropathic pain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The gross morphology and morphometry of the hippocampus, fornix, and corpus callosum in patients with severe non-missile traumatic brain injury (nmTBI) without obvious neuroradiological lesions was examined and the volumes of these structures were correlated with performance on memory tests. In addition, the predictability of the length of coma from the selected anatomical volumes was examined. METHOD: High spatial resolution T1 weighted MRI scans of the brain (1 mm3) and neuropsychological evaluations with standardised tests were performed at least 3 months after trauma in 19 patients. RESULTS: In comparison with control subjects matched in terms of gender and age, volume reduction in the hippocampus, fornix, and corpus callosum of the nmTBI patients was quantitatively significant. The length of coma correlated with the volume reduction in the corpus callosum. Immediate free recall of word lists correlated with the volume of the fornix and the corpus callosum. Delayed recall of word lists and immediate recall of the Rey figure both correlated with the volume of the fornix. Delayed recall of the Rey figure correlated with the volume of the fornix and the right hippocampus. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in severe nmTBI without obvious neuroradiological lesions there is a clear hippocampal, fornix, and callosal volume reduction. The length of coma predicts the callosal volume reduction, which could be considered a marker of the severity of axonal loss. A few memory test scores correlated with the volumes of the selected anatomical structures. This relationship with memory performance may reflect the diffuse nature of the damage, leading to the disruption of neural circuits at multiple levels and the progressive neural degeneration occurring in TBI.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to test the feasibility of the tractography technique based on diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) for the assessment of small infarcts involving the brainstem. METHODS: A patient who presented with an isolated left third cranial nerve palsy underwent magnetic resonance examination. Images were obtained by use of a whole-body, 1.5-T imager. Data were transferred to an off-line workstation for fiber tracking. RESULTS: The conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) performed using a 5 mm slice thickness could only depict an equivocal hyperintensity lesion located at the left paramedian midbrain. An additional thin-slice DTI was performed immediately after the initial DWI using a 3 mm slice thickness and was able to delineate the lesion more clearly. Image postprocessing of thin-slice DTI data revealed that the lesion location involved the course of the third cranial nerve tract, corresponding with the patient's clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: The tractography technique can be applied to assess fine neuronal structures of the brainstem, enabling direct clinicoradiological correlation of small infarcts involving this region},

abstract = {Knowledge of amygdalar and hippocampal development as they pertain to sex differences and laterality would help to understand not only brain development but also the relationship between brain volume and brain functions. However, few studies investigated development of these two regions, especially during infancy. The purpose of this study was to examine typical volumetric trajectories of amygdala and hippocampus from infancy to early adulthood by predicting sexual dimorphism and laterality. We performed a cross-sectional morphometric MRI study of amygdalar and hippocampal growth from 1 month to 25 years old, using 109 healthy individuals. The findings indicated significant non-linear age-related volume changes, especially during the first few years of life, in both the amygdala and hippocampus regardless of sex. The peak ages of amygdalar and hippocampal volumes came at the timing of preadolescence (9-11 years old). The female amygdala reached its peak age about one year and a half earlier than the male amygdala did. In addition, its rate of growth change decreased earlier in the females. Furthermore, both females and males displayed rightward laterality in the hippocampus, but only the males in the amygdala. The robust growth of the amygdala and hippocampus during infancy highlight the importance of this period for neural and functional development. The sex differences and laterality during development of these two regions suggest that sex-related factors such as sex hormones and functional laterality might affect brain development.},

This procedure incorporates both geometric information derived from the cortical model, and neuroanatomical convention, as found in the training set. The result is a complete labeling of cortical sulci and gyri. Examples are given from two different training sets generated using different neuroanatomical conventions, illustrating the flexibility of the algorithm. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling.},

@article{Garcia-Lorenzo2013,
abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is often used to characterize and quantify multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the brain and spinal cord. The number and volume of lesions have been used to evaluate MS disease burden, to track the progression of the disease and to evaluate the effect of new pharmaceuticals in clinical trials. Accurate identification of MS lesions in MR images is extremely difficult due to variability in lesion location, size and shape in addition to anatomical variability between subjects. Since manual segmentation requires expert knowledge, is time consuming and is subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, many methods have been proposed to automatically segment lesions. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the state of the art in automated multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation. From 1240 hits found initially with PubMed and Google scholar, our selection criteria identified 80 papers that described an automatic lesion segmentation procedure applied to MS. Only 47 of these included quantitative validation with at least one realistic image. In this paper, we describe the complexity of lesion segmentation, classify the automatic MS lesion segmentation methods found, and review the validation methods applied in each of the papers reviewed. Although many segmentation solutions have been proposed, including some with promising results using MRI data obtained on small groups of patients, no single method is widely employed due to performance issues related to the high variability of MS lesion appearance and differences in image acquisition. The challenge remains to provide segmentation techniques that work in all cases regardless of the type of MS, duration of the disease, or MRI protocol, and this within a comprehensive, standardized validation framework. MS lesion segmentation remains an open problem.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic pain conditions are complicated and challenging to live with. Capacity to adjust to such conditions may depend on the ability to self-regulate, that is, the ability to alter thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Self-regulation appears to rely on executive cognitive functions, and the current review, therefore, sought to draw attention to the impact of self-regulatory capacity and executive functions on chronic pain. DISCUSSION: Chronic pain conditions present with complex interactions of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physiological components for which self-regulatory ability is crucial. The ability to self-regulate varies, and self-regulatory strength appears to be a limited resource that can be fatigued. The many challenges of chronic pain conditions could, therefore, tax self-regulatory strength, leading to self-regulatory deficits. CONCLUSION: The current review proposes a relationship among pain, self-regulatory capacity, self-regulatory demands, executive functions, and self-regulatory fatigue, suggesting that executive functions and self-regulatory deficits are indeed part of the etiology and maintenance of chronic pain conditions},

THere are currently two opposing theories of pain: (i) specificity theory, which holds that pain is a special modality like vision or hearing, "with it's own central and peripheral apparatus", and (ii) pattern theory, which maintains that the nerve impulse pattern for pain is produced by intense stimulation of non-specific receptors since "there are no specific fibers and no specific endings". Both theories desrive from earlier concepts proposed by von Frey and Goldscheider in 1894, and historically they are held to be mutally exclusive. Since it is our purpose here to propose a new theory of pain mechanisms, we shall stat explicitly at the outset where we agree and disagree with specificity and pattern theories.},

abstract = {Pain and limitation of movement are two cardinal symptoms of temporomandibular disorders but it is unclear how one influences the other. The relationship between pain and movement is clinically significant but controversial with two major theories having been proposed: the Vicious Cycle Theory and the Pain Adaptation Model. The Vicious Cycle Theory proposes a vicious cycle between pain and muscle activity. This theory has little scientific basis but underpins many management strategies. The Pain Adaptation Model is more evidence-based and proposes that pain causes changes in muscle activity to limit movement and protect the sensory-motor system from further injury. The Pain Adaptation Model has many positive features but does not appear to explain the relation between pain and muscle activity in all situations. We propose that the relationship is influenced by the functional complexity of the sensory-motor system and the multidimensional nature of pain. This new Integrated Pain Adaptation Model states that pain results in a new recruitment strategy of motor units that is influenced by the multidimensional (i.e., biological and psychosocial) components of the pain experience. This new recruitment strategy aims to minimize pain and maintain homeostasis. This model emphasizes the individual reaction to pain and suggests a tailored approach towards management},

abstract = {OBJECT: The insula is one of the paralimbic structures and constitutes the invaginated portion of the cerebral cortex, forming the base of the sylvian fissure. The authors provide a detailed anatomical study of the insular region to assist in the process of conceptualizing a reliable surgical approach to allow for a successful course of surgery. METHODS: The topographic anatomy of the insular region was studied in 25 formalin-fixed brain specimens (50 hemispheres). The periinsular sulci (anterior, superior, and inferior) define the limits of the frontoorbital, frontoparietal, and temporal opercula, respectively. The opercula cover and enclose the insula. The limen insula is located in the depths of the sylvian fissure and constitutes the anterobasal portion of the insula. A central insular sulcus divides the insula into two portions, the anterior insula (larger) and the posterior insula (smaller). The anterior insula is composed of three principal short insular gyri (anterior, middle, and posterior) as well as the accessory and transverse insular gyri. All five gyri converge at the insular apex, which represents the most superficial aspect of the insula. The posterior insula is composed of the anterior and posterior long insular gyri and the postcentral insular sulcus, which separates them. The anterior insula was found to be connected exclusively to the frontal lobe, whereas the posterior insula was connected to both the parietal and temporal lobes. Opercular gyri and sulci were observed to interdigitate within the opercula and to interdigitate the gyri and sulci of the insula. Using the fiber dissection technique, various unique anatomical features and relationships of the insula were determined. CONCLUSIONS: The topographic anatomy of the insular region is described in this article, and a practical terminology for gyral and sulcal patterns of surgical significance is presented. This study clarifies and supplements the information presently available to help develop a more coherent surgical concept.},

abstract = {Accurately tracing the optic radiations in living humans has important implications for studying the relationship between tract structure or integrity and visual function, in health and disease. Probabilistic tractography is an established method for tracing white matter tracts in humans. Prior studies have used this method to trace the optic radiations, but operator-dependent factors, particularly variability in seed voxel placement and choice of connectivity threshold to select between tract and non-tract voxels, remain potential causes of significant variability. Methods using prior information to modify tract images risk introducing error by underestimating individual variability, particularly in subjects with abnormal anatomy. Finally, existing methods lack thorough validation against a histological standard, causing difficulty in evaluating individual methods, and quantitatively comparing methods. Here we describe a method for producing binary optic radiation images using an existing, well-validated tractography method. All stages are automated, including mask image generation, and thresholds are objectively selected by comparing tract images with existing probabilistic histological data in stereotaxic space. Data from two subject groups are presented; the first used to derive analysis parameters, and the second to test these parameters in an independent sample. Validation utilised a novel variant of receiver operating characteristic analysis, providing both justification for this method and a metric by which tractography methods might be compared generally. The resulting tracts match the histological data well; images generated in individuals matched the histological group data about as well as did images derived in individuals from that histological data set, with a low false positive rate.},

abstract = {We have implemented and validated an algorithm for three-dimensional positron emission tomography transmission-to-computed tomography registration in the chest, using mutual information as a similarity criterion. Inherent differences in the two imaging protocols produce significant nonrigid motion between the two acquisitions. A rigid body deformation combined with localized cubic B-splines is used to capture this motion. The deformation is defined on a regular grid and is parameterized by potentially several thousand coefficients. Together with a spline-based continuous representation of images and Parzen histogram estimates, our deformation model allows closed-form expressions for the criterion and its gradient. A limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is used in a hierarchical multiresolution framework to automatically align the images. To characterize the performance of the method, 27 scans from patients involved in routine lung cancer staging were used in a validation study. The registrations were assessed visually by two expert observers in specific anatomic locations using a split window validation technique. The visually reported errors are in the 0- to 6-mm range and the average computation time is 100 min on a moderate-performance workstation},

abstract = {Most patients with neuropathic pain symptoms present and are managed in primary care, with only a minority being referred for specialist clinical assessment and diagnoses. Previous reviews have focused mainly on specific neuropathic pain conditions based in specialist settings. This is the first systematic review of epidemiological studies of neuropathic pain in the general population. Electronic databases were searched from January 1966 to December 2012, and studies were included where the main focus was on neuropathic pain prevalence and/or incidence, either as part of a specific neuropathic pain-related condition or as a global entity in the general population. We excluded studies in which data were extracted from pain or other specialist clinics or focusing on specific population subgroups. Twenty-one articles were identified and underwent quality assessment and data extraction. Included studies differed in 3 main ways: method of data retrieval, case ascertainment tool used, and presentation of prevalence/incidence rates. This heterogeneity precluded any meta-analysis. We categorised comparable incidence and prevalence rates into 2 main subgroups: (1) chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics (range 3-17{\%}), and (2) neuropathic pain associated with a specific condition, including postherpetic neuralgia (3.9-42.0/100,000 person-years [PY]), trigeminal neuralgia (12.6-28.9/100,000 PY), painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (15.3-72.3/100,000 PY), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (0.2-0.4/100,000 PY). These differences highlight the importance of a standardised approach for identifying neuropathic pain in future epidemiological studies. A best estimate of population prevalence of pain with neuropathic characteristics is likely to lie between 6.9{\%} and 10{\%}.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) provides in vivo information about the pathology of multiple sclerosis lesions. Increases in mean diffusivity (MD) and reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) have been found and may represent axonal disruption. The optic nerve is an ideal structure for study by DT-MRI but previous clinical studies did not obtain the full diffusion tensor necessary to calculate MD and FA. In this study, a technique that was specifically developed to achieve full diffusion tensor measurements from the optic nerve (zonal oblique multislice (ZOOM) echoplanar imaging) was applied to 25 patients with a single unilateral episode of optic neuritis at least one year previously, and 15 controls. The intraorbital nerves were segmented on non-diffusion-weighted images and the regions of interest transferred to MD, FA, and eigenvalue maps to obtain quantitative data. Quantitative visual testing and electrophysiology were also performed. In affected nerves, mean MD and mean orthogonal eigenvalue lambda( perpendicular) were elevated, and mean FA reduced compared with clinically unaffected contralateral nerves (P {\textless} 0.001) and control nerves (P {\textless} 0.001). The mean principal eigenvalue lambda$\backslash$$\backslash$ was significantly increased in affected nerves compared to contralateral unaffected nerves (P = 0.04) but not compared to control nerves (P = 0.13). There was no association of clinical measures of visual function in affected eyes with the DT-MRI parameters but there was a significant correlation of the whole field visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitude with MD (r = -0.57, P = 0.006) and lambda( perpendicular) (r = -0.56, P = 0.007). These findings suggest that optic nerve DT-MRI measures provide an indication of the structural integrity of axons.},

abstract = {We summarize here our experience in the neurophysiological and neuroimaging assessment of spinal and brain neuromodulation for pain relief. Techniques reviewed include somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), nociceptive spinal (RIII) reflexes, and positron emission tomography (PET), which have been applied both to investigate the mechanisms and to optimize the application of neurostimulation procedures. SEPs are especially useful in the preoperative assessment of patients with neuropathic pain, as they allow the establishment of the functional state of the dorsal column system. Patients with strongly abnormal SEPs due to ganglionic or preganglionic pathology are not likely to benefit from spinal (SCS) or peripheral (TENS) neurostimulation, because ascending fibers disconnected from their soma will undergo rapid degeneration and not be excitable. In the postoperative period, nociceptive spinal reflexes yield objective data concerning the effects of neurostimulation on spinal circuitry. In our experience, the best clinical results are achieved in patients with preserved preoperative SEPs, in whom neurostimulation entails profound attenuation of nociceptive reflexes.PET-scan imaging techniques have recently been used to demonstrate changes in cerebral blood flow during new neuromodulation schemes such as motor cortex stimulation for pain control (MCS). PET studies highlight the thalamus as the key structure mediating functional MCS effects. Thalamic activation would trigger a cascade of synaptic events influencing activity in other pain-related structures including the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and upper brainstem. The combination of clinical electrophysiology and functional neuroimaging provides insight into the mechanisms of action of neuromodulation procedures, guides clinical decision, and contributes to optimize patient selection},

abstract = {Gyrification is the process by which the brain undergoes changes in surface morphology to create sulcal and gyral regions. The period of greatest development of brain gyrification is during the third trimester of pregnancy, a period of time in which the brain undergoes considerable growth. Little is known about changes in gyrification during childhood and adolescence, although considering the changes in gray matter volume and thickness during this time period, it is conceivable that alterations in the brain surface morphology could also occur during this period of development. The formation of gyri and sulci in the brain allows for compact wiring that promotes and enhances efficient neural processing. If cerebral function and form are linked through the organization of neural connectivity, then alterations in neural connectivity, i.e., synaptic pruning, may also alter the gyral and sulcal patterns of the brain. This paper reviews developmental theories of gyrification, computational techniques for measuring gyrification, and the potential interaction between gyrification and neuronal connectivity. We also present recent findings involving alterations in gyrification during childhood and adolescence.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This review highlights research on sex-based differences in pain perception and treatment. We sought to illuminate the complex factors contributing to differences in pain and analgesic responses between males and females, ranging from psychosocial to biological processes. DESIGN: We reviewed published studies of pain induction by chemical, electric, heat, surgical, or psychological means, and opioid and nonopioid analgesia comparing responses in men and women. RESULTS: A substantial body of research indicates that women experience greater clinical pain, suffer greater pain-related distress, and show heightened sensitivity to experimentally induced pain compared with men. Research on sex-based differences in the pain experience and treatment is beginning to uncover patterns that may enable tailoring of pain treatment to individual characteristics. The factors underpinning sex differences in the experience of pain are multifactorial and complex; for example, psychosocial factors such as pain-related catastrophizing may explain sex-based differences in reporting certain types of pain, as women tend to use catastrophizing to a greater degree. Gonadal hormone levels in cycling women also have a substantial impact on pain perception and analgesic response. Women perceive more pain during the luteal phase, and estrogen antagonists provide long-term pain relief in certain situations. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, greater understanding of the factors that commonly and differentially affect the disparity in pain perception, as well as analgesic response, are beginning to illuminate research targets and promising areas of therapeutic intervention for improved pain management.},

abstract = {Interactions between sensory pathways such as the visual and auditory systems are known to occur in the brain, but where they first occur is uncertain. Here we show a novel multimodal interaction evident at the eardrum. Ear canal microphone measurements in humans (n=19 ears in 16 subjects) and monkeys (n=5 ears in 3 subjects) performing a saccadic eye movement task to visual targets indicated that the eardrum moves in conjunction with the eye movement. The eardrum motion was oscillatory and began as early as 10 ms before saccade onset in humans or with saccade onset in monkeys. These eardrum movements, which we dub Eye Movement Related Eardrum Oscillations (EMREOs), occurred in the absence of a sound stimulus. The EMREOs' amplitude and phase depended on the direction and horizontal amplitude of the saccade. They lasted throughout the saccade and well into subsequent periods of steady fixation. We discuss the possibility that the mechanisms underlying EMREOs create eye movement-related binaural cues that may aid the brain in evaluating the relationship between visual and auditory stimulus locations as the eyes move.},

abstract = {Pain usually results from activation of nociceptive afferents by actually or potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. Pain may also arise by activity generated within the nervous system without adequate stimulation of its peripheral sensory endings. For this type of pain, the International Association for the Study of Pain introduced the term neuropathic pain, defined as "pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system." While this definition has been useful in distinguishing some characteristics of neuropathic and nociceptive types of pain, it lacks defined boundaries. Since the sensitivity of the nociceptive system is modulated by its adequate activation (e.g., by central sensitization), it has been difficult to distinguish neuropathic dysfunction from physiologic neuroplasticity. We present a more precise definition developed by a group of experts from the neurologic and pain community: pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. This revised definition fits into the nosology of neurologic disorders. The reference to the somatosensory system was derived from a wide range of neuropathic pain conditions ranging from painful neuropathy to central poststroke pain. Because of the lack of a specific diagnostic tool for neuropathic pain, a grading system of definite, probable, and possible neuropathic pain is proposed. The grade possible can only be regarded as a working hypothesis, which does not exclude but does not diagnose neuropathic pain. The grades probable and definite require confirmatory evidence from a neurologic examination. This grading system is proposed for clinical and research purposes},

@article{Prescott2009,
abstract = {Parkinson's disease, caused by the loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal projections, is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. The dopamine precursor levodopa (L-dopa) is the most effective treatment for the amelioration of Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms, but long-term administration can lead to disabling motor fluctuations and L-dopa -induced dyskinesias (LIDs). Studies in rat striatal slices have shown dopamine to be an essential component of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at the input to the basal ganglia, but dopamine is also released from ventrally projecting dendrites of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) on the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output structure of the basal ganglia. We characterized synaptic plasticity in the SNr using field potentials evoked with a nearby microelectrode (fEPs), in 18 Parkinson's disease patients undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). High frequency stimulation (HFS--four trains of 2 s at 100 Hz) in the SNr failed to induce a lasting change in test fEPs (1 Hz) amplitudes in patients OFF medication (decayed to baseline by 160 s). Following oral L-dopa administration, HFS induced a potentiation of the fEP amplitudes (+29.3{\%} of baseline at 160 s following a plateau). Our findings suggest that extrastriatal dopamine modulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at basal ganglia output neurons. Dopamine medication state clearly impacts fEP amplitude, and the lasting nature of the increase is reminiscent of LTP-like changes, indicating that aberrant synaptic plasticity may play a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has long been used to study multiple sclerosis (MS), more sensitive and specific approaches to studying both MS lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) are needed to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. Two MRI techniques thought to offer insight regarding myelin and axonal integrity are T(2) relaxation and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this study, metrics obtained from T(2) relaxation (specifically myelin water content (MWC) and long-T(2) fraction) and DTI experiments (in particular the fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity {\textless}D{\textgreater}, parallel diffusivity lambda(||), and perpendicular diffusivity lambda(perpendicular)) were compared for 19 MS patients within both lesion and contralateral NAWM with the goal of better understanding how each of the measures are affected by pathology. In particular, it was successfully determined that the detection of a long-T(2) signal within an MS lesion is indicative of a different underlying pathology than is present in lesions without long-T(2) signal. All of the diffusion metrics were significantly different in lesions with a long-T(2) signal than in those without. While no significant correlations were found between MWC and {\textless}D{\textgreater}, lambda(||) or lambda(perpendicular) in NAWM (R(2)=0.02-0.04, p{\textgreater}0.07), and only weak correlations were found in lesions without long-T(2) signal (R(2)=0.05-0.14, p{\textless}0.04), strong correlations were observed in lesions exhibiting long-T(2) signal (R(2)=0.54-0.61, p{\textless}0.0001)},

abstract = {Background: There are few reports on the outcome of surgical treatment of TGN without vascular compression. Methods: Between 1984 and 2004, 668 patients underwent MVD for TGN. In 21 patients (3.1{\%}), vascular compression was absent. The surgical strategy in these cases involved the following: (1) dissection and exposure of the entire trigeminal nerve root; (2) slight neurapraxia with bipolar tips at the trigeminal nerve root; and (3) isolation of trigeminal nerve with Teflon sponge fragments. Results: The patients' (female/male, 20:1) ages ranged from 33 to 77 years. Their right side was the most frequently involved (61.9{\%}). Their mean duration of pain before treatment was 7.6 years (range = 1-20 years). At surgical exploration, vascular compression or anatomical abnormalities were absent in 15 patients (71.4{\%}), arachnoidal thickening was present in 5 (23.8{\%}), and fiber dissociation of the trigeminal nerve was present in 1 (4.8{\%}). Mean follow-up after surgery was 17.7 months (range = 4-65 months). Immediate relief from pain occurred in all 21 patients. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, recurrence was maintained at 14.8{\%} for 12, 24, and 36 months, increasing to 43.2{\%} at 48 months. Permanent hypoesthesia was present in 6 patients (28.6{\%}), whereas loss of corneal reflex was observed transiently in 1 (4.8{\%}). Motor function of the trigeminal nerve was intact in all patients. No other complication was found. Conclusion: The proposed surgical plan of standard MVD plus slight trigeminal nerve root neurapraxia is a safe and effective management option for TGN without vascular compression. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cerebral abnormalities have been detected in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In comparison to BD with a later onset, early-onset BD has been found to have a poorer outcome. However, it is yet unknown whether neuroanatomical abnormalities differ between age-at-onset subgroups of the illness. We searched for cortical folding differences between early-onset (before 25 years) and intermediate-onset (between 25 and 45 years) BD patients. METHODS: Magnetic resonance images of 22 early-onset BD patients, 14 intermediate-onset BD patients, and 50 healthy participants were analyzed using a fully automated method to extract, label, and measure the sulcal area in the whole cortex. Cortical folding was assessed by computing global sulcal indices (the ratio between total sulcal area and total outer cortex area) for each hemisphere, and local sulcal indices for 12 predefined regions in both hemispheres. RESULTS: Intermediate-onset BD patients had a significantly reduced local sulcal index in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in comparison to both early-onset BD patients and healthy subjects, and lower global sulcal indices in both hemispheres in comparison to healthy subjects (p {\textless} 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Brain tissue volumes did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first evidence of a neuroanatomic difference between intermediate-onset and early-onset BD, which lends further support to the existence of different age-at-onset subgroups of BD},

abstract = {Reward prediction errors consist of the differences between received and predicted rewards. They are crucial for basic forms of learning about rewards and make us strive for more rewards-an evolutionary beneficial trait. Most dopamine neurons in the midbrain of humans, monkeys, and rodents signal a reward prediction error; they are activated by more reward than predicted (positive prediction error), remain at baseline activity for fully predicted rewards, and show depressed activity with less reward than predicted (negative prediction error). The dopamine signal increases nonlinearly with reward value and codes formal economic utility. Drugs of addiction generate, hijack, and amplify the dopamine reward signal and induce exaggerated, uncontrolled dopamine effects on neuronal plasticity. The striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex also show reward prediction error coding, but only in subpopulations of neurons. Thus, the important concept of reward prediction errors is implemented in neuronal hardware.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.},

@article{Ioannou2016,
abstract = {This paper investigates the connections between two state of the art classifiers: decision forests (DFs, including decision jungles) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Decision forests are computationally efficient thanks to their conditional computation property (computation is confined to only a small region of the tree, the nodes along a single branch). CNNs achieve state of the art accuracy, thanks to their representation learning capabilities. We present a systematic analysis of how to fuse conditional computation with representation learning and achieve a continuum of hybrid models with different ratios of accuracy vs. efficiency. We call this new family of hybrid models conditional networks. Conditional networks can be thought of as: i) decision trees augmented with data transformation operators, or ii) CNNs, with block-diagonal sparse weight matrices, and explicit data routing functions. Experimental validation is performed on the common task of image classification on both the CIFAR and Imagenet datasets. Compared to state of the art CNNs, our hybrid models yield the same accuracy with a fraction of the compute cost and much smaller number of parameters.},

@article{Fillard2011,
abstract = {As it provides the only method for mapping white matter fibers in vivo, diffusion MRI tractography is gaining importance in clinical and neuroscience research. However, despite the increasing availability of different diffusion models and tractography algorithms, it remains unclear how to select the optimal fiber reconstruction method, given certain imaging parameters. Consequently, it is of utmost importance to have a quantitative comparison of these models and algorithms and a deeper understanding of the corresponding strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we use a common dataset with known ground truth and a reproducible methodology to quantitatively evaluate the performance of various diffusion models and tractography algorithms. To examine a wide range of methods, the dataset, but not the ground truth, was released to the public for evaluation in a contest, the "Fiber Cup". 10 fiber reconstruction methods were evaluated. The results provide evidence that: 1. For high SNR datasets, diffusion models such as (fiber) orientation distribution functions correctly model the underlying fiber distribution and can be used in conjunction with streamline tractography, and 2. For medium or low SNR datasets, a prior on the spatial smoothness of either the diffusion model or the fibers is recommended for correct modelling of the fiber distribution and proper tractography results. The phantom dataset, the ground truth fibers, the evaluation methodology and the results obtained so far will remain publicly available on: http://www.lnao.fr/spip.php?rubrique79 to serve as a comparison basis for existing or new tractography methods. New results can be submitted to fibercup09@gmail.com and updates will be published on the webpage.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is activated during detection of salient stimuli, including pain, in the sensory environment. Right TPJ damage more often produces spatial neglect than left TPJ damage. We recently reported a right lateralized system of white matter connectivity of the TPJ. However, lateralization in intrinsic TPJ functional connectivity during a task/stimuli-independent state has not been fully characterized. Here we used resting-state functional MRI in healthy humans to compare the functional connectivity of right and left TPJ with salience- and attention-related brain networks. Independent components analysis revealed that both right and left TPJ were functionally connected with a network that included the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and mid-cingulate cortex, considered to be the salience/ventral attention network. Dual regression revealed this network was more strongly connected with right TPJ than left TPJ. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis showed 1) negative connectivity the TPJ bilaterally with the "default mode network"; 2) positive connectivity of TPJ bilaterally with the salience/ventral attention network; 3) stronger connectivity between right TPJ compared with left TPJ with regions within the salience/ventral attention network and mid-insula, S2, and temporal/parietal opercula (implicated in pain); and 4) stronger connectivity of left TPJ compared with right TPJ with the "executive control network," including the dorsomedial/medial PFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and cerebellum (crus I/II). Our findings build on classic lesion and neuroimaging studies, demonstrating a complex spatial network organization of lateralization in TPJ functional connectivity in the absence of an overt stimulus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess how well the anatomy of the jugular foramen (JF) could be displayed by 3T MR imaging by using a 3D contrast-enhanced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition sequence (CE-FIESTA) and a 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiographic sequence (CE-MRA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients free of skull base lesions were imaged on a 3T MR imaging scanner using CE-FIESTA and CE-MRA. Two readers analyzed the images in collaboration, with the following objectives: 1) to score the success with which these sequences depicted the glossopharyngeal (CNIX) and vagus (CNX) nerves, their ganglia, and the spinal root of the accessory nerve (spCNXI) within the JF, and 2) to determine the value of anatomic landmarks for the in vivo identification of these structures. RESULTS: CE-FIESTA and CE-MRA displayed CNIX in 90{\%} and 100{\%} of cases, respectively, CNX in 94{\%} and 100{\%}, and spCNXI in 51{\%} and 0{\%} of cases. The superior ganglion of CNIX was discernible in 89.8{\%} and 87.8{\%}; the inferior ganglion of CNIX, in 73{\%} and 100{\%}; and the superior ganglion of CNX, in 98{\%} and 100{\%} of cases. Landmarks useful for identifying these structures were the inferior petrosal sinus and the external opening of the cochlear aqueduct. CONCLUSIONS: This study protocol is excellent for displaying the complex anatomy of the JF and related structures. It is expected to aid in detecting small pathologies affecting the JF and in planning the best surgical approach to lesions affecting the JF},

abstract = {The identification of signals of very recent positive selection provides information about the adaptation of modern humans to local conditions. We report here on a genome-wide scan for signals of very recent positive selection in favor of variants that have not yet reached fixation. We describe a new analytical method for scanning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for signals of recent selection, and apply this to data from the International HapMap Project. In all three continental groups we find widespread signals of recent positive selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed a set of SNPs that can be used to tag the strongest approximately 250 signals of recent selection in each population.},

However, identifying the precise neurons supporting a given memory (the memory trace) has been a long-standing challenge. We have shown previously that lateral amygdala (LA) neurons with increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) are preferentially activated by fear memory expression, which suggests that they are selectively recruited into the memory trace. We used an inducible diphtheria-toxin strategy to specifically ablate these neurons. Selectively deleting neurons overexpressing CREB (but not a similar portion of random LA neurons) after learning blocked expression of that fear memory. The resulting memory loss was robust and persistent, which suggests that the memory was permanently erased. These results establish a causal link between a specific neuronal subpopulation and memory expression, thereby identifying critical neurons within the memory trace.},

Sixty-seven studies (2,290 participants) using various neurophysiological measures were included. There is conflicting evidence of altered M1 structure, organization, and function for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain conditions. Meta-analyses provided evidence of increased M1 long-interval intracortical inhibition in chronic pain populations. For most measures, the evidence of M1 changes in chronic pain populations is inconclusive. Perspective: This review synthesizes the evidence of altered M1 structure, organization, and function in chronic pain populations. For most measures, M1 changes are inconsistent between studies and more research with larger samples and rigorous methodology is required to elucidate M1 changes in chronic pain populations.},

abstract = {The diffusion in voxels with multidirectional fibers can be quite complicated and not necessarily well characterized by the standard diffusion tensor model. High angular resolution diffusion-weighted acquisitions have recently been proposed as a method to investigate such voxels, but the reconstruction methods proposed require sophisticated estimation schemes. We present here a simple algorithm for the identification of diffusion anisotropy based upon the variance of the estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a function of measurement direction. The rationale for this method is discussed, and results in normal human subjects acquired with a novel diffusion-weighted stimulated-echo spiral acquisition are presented which distinguish areas of anisotropy that are not apparent in the relative anisotropy maps derived from the standard diffusion tensor model.

abstract = {Cortical surface-based analysis has been widely used in anatomical and functional studies because it is geometrically appropriate for the cortex. One of the main challenges in the cortical surface-based analysis is to optimize the alignment of the cortical hemispheric surfaces across individuals. In this paper, we introduce a multi-manifold large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (MM-LDDMM) algorithm that allows simultaneously carrying the cortical hemispheric surface and its sulcal curves from one to the other through a flow of diffeomorphisms. We present an algorithm based on recent derivation of a law of momentum conservation for the geodesics of diffeomorphic flow. Once a template is fixed, the space of initial momentum becomes an appropriate space for studying shape via geodesic flow since the flow at any point on curves and surfaces along the geodesic is completely determined by the momentum at the origin. We solve for trajectories (geodesics) of the kinetic energy by computing its variation with respect to the initial momentum and by applying a gradient descent scheme. The MM-LDDMM algorithm optimizes the initial momenta encoding the anatomical variation of each individual relative to a common coordinate system in a linear space, which provides a natural scheme for shape deformation average and template (or atlas) generation. We applied the MM-LDDMM algorithm for constructing the templates for the cortical surface and 14 sulcal curves of each hemisphere using a group of 40 subjects. The estimated template shape reflects regions which are highly variable across these subjects. Compared with existing single-manifold LDDMM algorithms, such as the LDDMM-curve mapping and the LDDMM-surface mapping, the MM-LDDMM mapping provides better results in terms of surface to surface distances in five predefined regions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the crossing fiber trajectory through the corpus callosum using distortion-corrected diffusion tensor tractography in the human brain. METHODS: After correcting distortion associated with large-diffusion gradients, T2-weighted echo planar images (EPIs) acquired from 10 right-handed healthy men were coregistered into T2-weighted fast spin echo images using linear through sixth-order nonlinear, 3-dimensional, polynomial warping functions. The optimal transformation parameters were also applied to the distortion-corrected diffusion-weighted EPIs. Diffusion tensor tractography through the corpus callosum was reconstructed, employing the "1 or 2 regions of interest" method. RESULTS: Compared with the lines through the genu, those through the rostrum ran more inferiorly and seemed to enter the orbital gyrus. Those lines entering posterior temporal white matter (tapetum) crossed through the ventral portion of the splenium and were clearly distinguished from lines that reached parieto-occipital white matter (forceps major). CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor tractography is a feasible noninvasive tool to evaluate commissural fiber trajectory},

An ever-increasing number of studies have established sex differences in response to pain and analgesics. These studies have demonstrated that the differences between the sexes appear to have a biological and psychological basis. We will provide brief review of the epidemiology, rodent, and human experimental findings. The controversies and widespread disagreement in the literature highlight the need for a progressive approach to the questions involving collaborative efforts between those trained in the basic and clinical biomedical sciences and those in the epidemiological and social sciences. In order for patients suffering from acute and/or chronic pain to benefit from this work, the approach has to involve the use or development of clinically relevant models of nociception or pain to answer the basic, but complex, question.

abstract = {OBJECT The authors report on a novel technique to identify neurovascular compression in trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Using 3D reconstructed high-resolution balanced fast-field echo (BFFE) images fused with 3D time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and Gd-enhanced 3D spoiled gradient recalled sequence, it is possible to objectively visualize the trigeminal nerve and nearby arteries and veins. METHODS Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 18 patients with unilateral TN using 3 sequences: BFFE, 3D TOF angiography, and 3D Gd-enhanced imaging. The images were imported into OsiriX imaging software; after their fusion, a 3D false-color reconstruction was produced using surface rendering. The reconstructed images objectively differentiate nerves and vessels and can be viewed from any angle, including the anticipated surgical approach. RESULTS Fifteen patients were predicted to have neurovascular compression on the symptomatic side (9 arterial and 6 venous compressions). All patients had a vascular structure that was identical in location and configuration to that predicted on preoperative analysis. The 3 patients without predicted compression underwent surgical exploration because they manifested the classic symptoms. As expected, exploration in 2 of these patients revealed no offending vessel. The third patient had a small vein embedded in the trigeminal nerve that was beyond the resolution of the 3D Gd-enhanced study. CONCLUSIONS Combining BFFE with MR angiography and Gd-enhanced MR images capitalizes on the advantages of both techniques, enabling MR angiography and contrast-enhanced MR imaging discrimination of vascular structures at BFFE resolution. This results in an unambiguous 3D image that can be used to identify the neurovascular compression and plan the surgical approach.},

abstract = {We analyzed the properties of the logarithm of the Rician distribution leading to a full characterization of the probability law of the errors in the linearized diffusion tensor model. An almost complete lack of bias, a simple relation between the variance and the signal-to-noise ratio in the original complex data, and a close approximation to normality facilitated estimation of the tensor components by an iterative weighted least squares algorithm. The theory of the linear model has also been used to derive the distribution of mean diffusivity, to develop an informative statistical test for relative lack of fit of the ellipsoidal (or spherical) model compared to an unrestricted linear model in which no specific shape is assumed for the diffusion process, and to estimate the signal-to-noise ratios in the original data. The false discovery rate (FDR) has been used to control thresholds for statistical significance in the context of multiple comparisons at voxel level. The methods are illustrated by application to three diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets of clinical interest: a healthy volunteer, a patient with acute brain injury, and a patient with hydrocephalus. Interestingly, some salient features, such as a region normally comprising the basal ganglia and internal capsule, and areas of edema in patients with brain injury and hydrocephalus, had patterns of error largely independent from their mean diffusivities. These observations were made in brain regions with sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratios ({\textgreater}2) to justify the assumptions of the log Rician probability model. The combination of diffusivity and its error may provide added value in diagnostic DTI of acute pathologic expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment in brain parenchymal tissue},

abstract = {OBJECT Microvascular decompression (MVD) and percutaneous ablation surgery have historically been the treatments of choice for medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Gamma knife surgery (GKS) has been used as an alternative, minimally invasive treatment in TN. In the present study, the authors evaluated the long-term results of GKS in the treatment of TN. METHODS From 1996 to 2003, 151 cases of TN were treated with GKS. In this group, radiosurgery was performed once in 136 patients, twice in 14 patients, and three times in one patient. The types of TN were as follows: 122 patients with typical TN, three with atypical TN, four with multiple sclerosis-associated TN, and seven with TN and a history of a cavernous sinus tumor. In each case, the chosen radiosurgical target was located 2 to 4 mm anterior to the entry of the trigeminal nerve into the pons. The maximal radiation doses ranged from 50 to 90 Gy. The median age of the patients was 68 years (range 22-90 years), and the median time from diagnosis to GKS was 72 months (range 1-276 months). The median follow up was 19 months (range 2-96 months). Clinical outcomes and postradiosurgical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate factors that correlated with a favorable, pain-free outcome. The mean time to relief of pain was 24 days (range 1-180 days). Forty-seven, 45, and 34{\%} of patients were pain free without medication at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow ups, respectively. Ninety, 77, and 70{\%} of patients experienced some improvement in pain at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow ups, respectively. Thirty-three (27{\%}) of 122 patients with initial improvement subsequently experienced pain recurrence a median of 12 months (range 2-34 months) post-GKS. Among those whose symptoms recurred, 14 patients underwent additional GKS, six MVD, four glycerol injection, and one patient a percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy. Twelve patients (9{\%}) suffered the onset of new facial numbness post-GKS. Changes on MR images post-GKS were noted in nine patients (7{\%}). On univariate analysis, right-sided neuralgia (p = 0.0002) and a previous neurectomy (p = 0.04) correlated with a pain-free outcome; on multivariate analysis, both rightsided neuralgia (p = 0.032) and patient age (p = 0.05) were statistically significant. New onset of facial numbness following GKS correlated with undergoing more than one GKS (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS At the last follow up, GKS effected pain relief in 44{\%} of patients. Some degree of pain improvement at 3 years post-GKS was noted in 70{\%} of patients with TN. Although less effective than MVD, GKS remains a reasonable treatment option for those unwilling or unable to undergo more invasive surgical approaches and offers a low risk of side effects.},

abstract = {Matrix factorization models are the current dominant approach for resolving meaningful data-driven features in neuroimaging data. Among them, independent component analysis (ICA) is arguably the most widely used for identifying functional networks, and its success has led to a number of versatile extensions to group and multimodal data. However there are indications that ICA may have reached a limit in flexibility and representational capacity, as the majority of such extensions are case-driven, custom-made solutions that are still contained within the class of mixture models. In this work, we seek out a principled and naturally extensible approach and consider a probabilistic model known as a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). An RBM separates linear factors from functional brain imaging data by fitting a probability distribution model to the data. Importantly, the solution can be used as a building block for more complex (deep) models, making it naturally suitable for hierarchical and multimodal extensions that are not easily captured when using linear factorizations alone. We investigate the capability of RBMs to identify intrinsic networks and compare its performance to that of well-known linear mixture models, in particular ICA. Using synthetic and real task fMRI data, we show that RBMs can be used to identify networks and their temporal activations with accuracy that is equal or greater than that of factorization models. The demonstrated effectiveness of RBMs supports its use as a building block for deeper models, a significant prospect for future neuroimaging research. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the recent advances in knowledge of brainstem mechanisms related to craniofacial pain. It also draws attention to their clinical implications, and concludes with a brief overview and suggestions for future research directions. It first describes the general organizational features of the trigeminal brainstem sensory nuclear complex (VBSNC), including its input and output properties and intrinsic characteristics that are commensurate with its strategic role as the major brainstem relay of many types of somatosensory information derived from the face and mouth. The VBSNC plays a crucial role in craniofacial nociceptive transmission, as evidenced by clinical, behavioral, morphological, and electrophysiological data that have been especially derived from studies of the relay of cutaneous nociceptive afferent inputs through the subnucleus caudalis of the VBSNC. The recent literature, however, indicates that some fundamental differences exist in the processing of cutaneous vs. other craniofacial nociceptive inputs to the VBSNC, and that rostral components of the VBSNC may also play important roles in some of these processes. Modulatory mechanisms are also highlighted, including the neurochemical substrate by which nociceptive transmission in the VBSNC can be modulated. In addition, the long-term consequences of peripheral injury and inflammation and, in particular, the neuroplastic changes that can be induced in the VBSNC are emphasized in view of the likely role that central sensitization, as well as peripheral sensitization, can play in acute and chronic pain. The recent findings also provide new insights into craniofacial pain behavior and are particularly relevant to many approaches currently in use for the management of pain and to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic procedures aimed at manipulating peripheral inputs and central processes underlying nociceptive transmission and its control within the VBSNC.},

abstract = {Large databases of high-resolution structural MR images are being assembled to quantitatively examine the relationships between brain anatomy, disease progression, treatment regimens, and genetic influences upon brain structure. Quantifying brain structures in such large databases cannot be practically accomplished by expert neuroanatomists using hand-tracing. Rather, this research will depend upon automated methods that reliably and accurately segment and quantify dozens of brain regions. At present, there is little guidance available to help clinical research groups in choosing such tools. Thus, our goal was to compare the performance of two popular and fully automated tools, FSL/FIRST and FreeSurfer, to expert hand tracing in the measurement of the hippocampus and amygdala. Volumes derived from each automated measurement were compared to hand tracing for percent volume overlap, percent volume difference, across-sample correlation, and 3-D group-level shape analysis. In addition, sample size estimates for conducting between-group studies were computed for a range of effect sizes. Compared to hand tracing, hippocampal measurements with FreeSurfer exhibited greater volume overlap, smaller volume difference, and higher correlation than FIRST, and sample size estimates with FreeSurfer were closer to hand tracing. Amygdala measurement with FreeSurfer was also more highly correlated to hand tracing than FIRST, but exhibited a greater volume difference than FIRST. Both techniques had comparable volume overlap and similar sample size estimates. Compared to hand tracing, a 3-D shape analysis of the hippocampus showed FreeSurfer was more accurate than FIRST, particularly in the head and tail. However, FIRST more accurately represented the amygdala shape than FreeSurfer, which inflated its anterior and posterior surfaces.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the microanatomy of the central myelin-peripheral myelin transitional zone (TZ) in trigeminal nerves from cadavers.

METHODS: One hundred trigeminal nerves from 50 cadaver heads were examined. The cisternal portion of the nerve (from the pons to Meckel's cave) was measured. Horizontal sections were stained and photographed. The photomicrographs were used to measure the extent of central myelin on the medial and lateral aspects of the nerve and to classify TZ shapes.

RESULTS: The cisternal portions of the specimens ranged from 8 to 15 mm long (mean, 12.3 mm; median, 11.9 mm). The data from the photomicrographs revealed that the extent of central myelin (distance from pons to TZ) on the medial aspect of the nerve (range, 0.1-2.5 mm; mean, 1.13 mm; median, 1 mm) was shorter than that on the lateral aspect (range, 0.17-6.75 mm; mean, 2.47 mm; median, 2.12 mm).

CONCLUSION: The data definitively prove that the root entry zone (REZ, nerve-pons junction) and TZ of the trigeminal nerve are distinct sites and that these terms should never be used interchangeably. The measurements showed that the central myelin occupies only the initial one-fourth of the trigeminal nerve length. If trigeminal neuralgia is caused exclusively by vascular compression of the central myelin, the problem vessel would always have to be located in this region. However, it is well known that pain from trigeminal neuralgia can resolve after vascular decompression at more distal sites. This suggests that the effects of surgical decompression are caused by another mechanism.},

abstract = {A diffusion deconvolution method is proposed to apply deconvolution to the diffusion orientation distribution function (dODF) and calculate the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF), which is defined as the orientation distribution of the fiber spin density. The dODF can be obtained from q-space imaging methods such as q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), and thus the method can be applied to various diffusion sampling schemes. A phantom study was conducted to compare the angular resolution of the fODF with the dODF, and the in vivo datasets were acquired using single-shell, two-shell, and grid sampling schemes, which were then reconstructed by QBI, GQI, and DSI, respectively. The phantom study showed that the fODF significantly improved the angular resolution over the dODF at 45- and 60-degree crossing angles. The in vivo study showed consistent fODF regardless of the applied sampling schemes and reconstruction methods, and the ability to resolve crossing fibers was improved in reduced sampling condition. The fiber spin density obtained from deconvolution showed a higher contrast-to-noise ratio than the fractional anisotropy (FA) mapping, and further application on tractography showed that the fiber spin density can be used to determine the termination of fiber tracts. In conclusion, the proposed deconvolution method is generally applicable to different q-space imaging methods. The calculated fODF improves the angular resolution and also provides a quantitative index of fiber spin density to refine fiber tracking.},

abstract = {The personal experience of pain is complex and depends on physiological and psychological factors. From this latter category, pain catastrophizing plays an important role in pain behavior and response. We aimed to determine the effect of pain catastrophizing on central nociceptive processing in healthy individuals. Functional MRI was performed during two pain intensity levels evoked by electrical median nerve stimulation in 22 healthy individuals. Pain catastrophizing scores were determined for all subjects. Pain catastrophizing was not related to activity in regions associated with sensory-discriminative aspects of pain, such as the primary or secondary somatosensory cortex. Instead, during mild pain, there was a relationship between catastrophizing and activity in cortical regions associated with affective, attention, and motor aspects of pain, including dorsolateral prefrontal, insula, rostral anterior cingulate, premotor, and parietal cortices. During more intense pain, prefrontal cortical regions implicated in the top-down modulation of pain were negatively correlated with catastrophizing. These findings can be viewed from the framework of an attention model of pain catastrophizing, whereby a cortical vigilance network is engaged during mild pain, but diminished prefrontal cortical modulation impedes disengaging from and suppressing pain during more intense pain. These findings may also implicate catastrophizing in the progression to or persistence of chronic pain},

abstract = {The human insula is hidden in the depth of the cerebral hemisphere by the overlying frontal and temporal opercula, and consists of three cytoarchitectonically distinct regions: the anterior agranular area, posterior granular area, and the transitional dysgranular zone; each has distinct histochemical staining patterns and specific connectivity. Even though there are several studies reporting the functional connectivity of the insula with the cingulated cortex, its relationships with other brain areas remain elusive in humans. Therefore, we decided to use resting state functional connectivity to elucidate in details its connectivity, in terms of cortical and subcortical areas, and also of lateralization. We investigated correlations in BOLD fluctuations between specific regions of interest of the insula and other brain areas of right-handed healthy volunteers, on both sides of the brain. Our findings document two major complementary networks involving the ventral-anterior and dorsal-posterior insula: one network links the anterior insula to the middle and inferior temporal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, and is primarily related to limbic regions which play a role in emotional aspects; the second links the middle-posterior insula to premotor, sensorimotor, supplementary motor and middle-posterior cingulate cortices, indicating a role for the insula in sensorimotor integration. The clear bipartition of the insula was confirmed by negative correlation analysis. Correlation maps are partially lateralized: the salience network, related to the ventral anterior insula, displays stronger connections with the anterior cingulate cortex on the right side, and with the frontal cortex on the left side; the posterior network has stronger connections with the superior temporal cortex and the occipital cortex on the right side. These results are in agreement with connectivity studies in primates, and support the use of resting state functional analysis to investigate connectivity in the living human brain.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The human insula constitutes the invaginated portion of the cerebral cortex and is less well understood than other cortical areas because of its hidden location. Our purpose was to study the neurosurgical anatomy of the human insula via a combined and comparative study of its gross and imaging anatomy. METHODS: We totally studied the anatomy of 148 normal insulae in anatomic specimens and radiologic images. We evaluated the number of all insular gyri (short and long), we statistically analyzed our results, and we made comparisons among hemispheres and gender. We also compared the two studies. Finally, we searched in the literature to make comparisons with other authors and to add our experience to the today existing knowledge of the insular anatomy. RESULTS: We found a significantly greater value of the insular gyri number for males, potential underestimation of the real insular gyri number by MRI and that the classic insular gyri pattern can rarely be absent. The middle short insular gyrus can be indistinguishable more likely on MRIs than during surgery, the long insular gyri are less curved than the short gyri, and finally, the insular perforating vessels usually originate at the inferior insular part. CONCLUSIONS: Deep knowledge of the gross, imaging, and surgical anatomy of the insula is of paramount importance for neurosurgeons dealing with disorders in this area. The male insula is larger (increased gyri pattern) than the female. Moreover, the classic insular gyri pattern can rarely be absent, probably as a normal anatomic variation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate cerebral activations underlying touch-evoked pain (dynamic-mechanical allodynia) in patients with neuropathic pain. METHODS: fMRI was used in 12 patients with complex regional pain syndromes (CRPSs). Allodynia was elicited by gently brushing the affected CRPS hand. Elicited pain ratings were recorded online to obtain pain-weighted predictors. Both activations and deactivations of blood oxygenation level-dependent signals were investigated. RESULTS: Nonpainful stimulation on the nonaffected hand activated contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1), bilateral insula, and secondary somatosensory cortices (S2). In contrast, allodynia led to widespread cerebral activations, including contralateral S1 and motor cortex (M1), parietal association cortices (PA), bilateral S2, insula, frontal cortices, and both anterior and posterior parts of the cingulate cortex (aACC and pACC). Deactivations were detected in the visual, vestibular, and temporal cortices. When rating-weighted predictors were implemented, only few activations remained (S1/PA cortex, bilateral S2/insular cortices, pACC). CONCLUSIONS: Allodynic stimulation recruits a complex cortical network. Activations include not only nociceptive but also motor and cognitive processing. Using a covariance approach (i.e., implementation of rating-weighted predictors) facilitates the detection of a neuronal matrix involved in the encoding of allodynia. The pattern of cortical deactivation during allodynia may hint at a shift of activation from tonically active sensory systems, like visual and vestibular cortices, into somatosensory-related brain areas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will show abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) in the normal-appearing brain after prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). These abnormalities will be more accentuated in patients with underlying vascular risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study by use of DTI and conventional T2-weighted MR images was performed with a 1.5T unit with 16 patients with small cell lung cancer and undergoing PCI. All of the T2-weighted images were evaluated with respect to abnormalities in signal intensity of white matter as markers of radiation damage. Measurements of FA were performed before, at the end of, and 6 weeks after radiation therapy. On the FA maps, the bifrontal white matter, the corona radiata, the cerebellum, and the brain stem were evaluated. FA values were compared with respect to age, demographic, and vascular risk factors. Statistical analyses (Friedman test, Wilcoxon test, and Mann-Whitney U test) were performed. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy decreased significantly in supratentorial and infratentorial normal-appearing white matter from the beginning to the end of PCI (P {\textless} .01). A further decline in FA occurred 6 weeks after irradiation (P {\textless} .05). A stronger reduction in FA was observed in patients with more than 1 vascular risk factor. There was an age-related reduction of white matter FA. Patients 65 years and older showed a trend toward a stronger reduction in FA. CONCLUSION: During the acute phase, after PCI, patients with many vascular risk factors showed stronger damage in the white matter compared with patients with only 1 risk factor},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of cortical folding may provide insight into neurodevelopment deviations, which, in turn, can predispose to depression that responds particularly poorly to medications. We hypothesized that patients with treatment-resistant depression would exhibit measurable alterations in cortical folding. METHODS: We computed hemispheric global sulcal indices (g-SIs) in T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance images obtained from 76 patients and 70 healthy controls. We separately searched for anatomic deviations in patients with bipolar disorder (16 patients with treatment-resistant depression, 25 with euthymia) and unipolar depression (35 patients with treatment-resistant depression). RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, both groups of patients with treatment-resistant depression exhibited reduced g-SIs: in the right hemisphere among patients with bipolar disorder and in both hemispheres among those with unipolar depression. Patients with euthymic bipolar disorder did not differ significantly from depressed patients or healthy controls. Among patients with bipolar disorder who were taking lithium, we found positive correlations between current lithium dose and g-SIs in both hemispheres. LIMITATIONS: We cannot estimate the extent to which the observed g-SI reductions are linked to treatment resistance and to what extent they are state-dependent. Furthermore, we cannot disentangle the impact of medications from that of the affective disorder. Finally, there is interindividual variation and overlap of g-SIs among patients and healthy controls that need to be considered when interpreting our results. CONCLUSION: Reduced global cortical folding surface appears to be characteristic of patients with treatment-resistant depression, either unipolar or bipolar. In patients with bipolar disorder, treatment with lithium may modify cortical folding surface.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that the anterior, mid, and posterior division of the insula subserve different functions in the perception of pain. The anterior insula (AI) has predominantly been associated with cognitive-affective aspects of pain, while the mid and posterior divisions have been implicated in sensory-discriminative processing. We examined whether this functional segregation is paralleled by differences in (1) structural and (2) resting state connectivity and (3) in correlations with pain-relevant psychological traits. Analyses were restricted to the 3 insular subdivisions and other pain-related brain regions. Both type of analyses revealed largely overlapping results. The AI division was predominantly connected to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (structural and resting state connectivity) and orbitofrontal cortex (structural connectivity). In contrast, the posterior insula showed strong connections to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI; structural connectivity) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII; structural and resting state connectivity). The mid insula displayed a hybrid connectivity pattern with strong connections with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, SII (structural and resting state connectivity) and SI (structural connectivity). Moreover, resting state connectivity revealed strong connectivity of all 3 subdivisions with the thalamus. On the behavioural level, AI structural connectivity was related to the individual degree of pain vigilance and awareness that showed a positive correlation with AI-amygdala connectivity and a negative correlation with AI-rostral anterior cingulate cortex connectivity. In sum, our findings show a differential structural and resting state connectivity for the anterior, mid, and posterior insula with other pain-relevant brain regions, which might at least partly explain their different functional profiles in pain processing.},

abstract = {PURPOSE A patient-oriented classification scheme for facial pains commonly encountered in neurosurgical practice is proposed. CONCEPT This classification is driven principally by the patient's history. RATIONALE The scheme incorporates descriptions for so-called "atypical" trigeminal neuralgias and facial pains but minimizes the pejorative, accepting that the physiology of neuropathic pains could reasonably encompass a variety of pain sensations, both episodic and constant. Seven diagnostic labels result: trigeminal neuralgia Types 1 and 2 refer to patients with the spontaneous onset of facial pain and either predominant episodic or constant pain, respectively. Trigeminal neuropathic pain results from unintentional injury to the trigeminal nerve from trauma or surgery, whereas trigeminal deafferentation pain results from injury to the nerve by peripheral nerve ablation, gangliolysis, or rhizotomy in an intentional attempt to treat either trigeminal neuralgia or other facial pain. Postherpetic neuralgia follows a cutaneous herpes zoster outbreak (shingles) in the trigeminal distribution, and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia results from multiple sclerosis. The final category, atypical facial pain, is synonymous with facial pain secondary to a somatoform pain disorder. Atypical facial pain can be suspected but not diagnosed by history and can be diagnosed only with detailed and objective psychological testing. CONCLUSION This diagnostic classification would allow more rigorous and objective natural history and outcome studies of facial pain in the future.},

abstract = {The neuroimaging of experimental and clinical pain has revolutionised our understanding of the physiological responses to pain and paved the way for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain syndromes. Extensive research on the central mechanisms regarding the sensory-discriminative dimensions of pain have revealed a complex network of cortical and subcortical brain structures involved in the transmission and integration of pain, the so-called pain matrix. Although brain imaging and pharmacological studies have generated some insight into the circuitry that may be involved in the generation of chronic pain symptoms, further research into brain imaging of chronic pain is clearly warranted. However, modern neuroimaging suggests that the chronification of pain (and headaches) involves functional and structural plasticity of both the central and peripheral nervous system.},

abstract = {The distinction between processes used to perceive and understand the self and others has received considerable attention in psychology and neuroscience. Brain findings highlight a role for various regions, in particular the medial PFC (mPFC), in supporting judgments about both the self and others. We performed a meta-analysis of 107 neuroimaging studies of self- and other-related judgments using multilevel kernel density analysis [Kober, H., {\&} Wager, T. D. Meta-analyses of neuroimaging data. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews, 1, 293-300, 2010]. We sought to determine what brain regions are reliably involved in each judgment type and, in particular, what the spatial and functional organization of mPFC is with respect to them. Relative to nonmentalizing judgments, both self- and other judgments were associated with activity in mPFC, ranging from ventral to dorsal extents, as well as common activation of the left TPJ and posterior cingulate. A direct comparison between self- and other judgments revealed that ventral mPFC as well as left ventrolateral PFC and left insula were more frequently activated by self-related judgments, whereas dorsal mPFC, in addition to bilateral TPJ and cuneus, was more frequently activated by other-related judgments. Logistic regression analyses revealed that ventral and dorsal mPFC lay at opposite ends of a functional gradient: The z coordinates reported in individual studies predicted whether the study involved self- or other-related judgments, which were associated with increasingly ventral or dorsal portions of mPFC, respectively. These results argue for a distributed rather than localizationist account of mPFC organization and support an emerging view on the functional heterogeneity of mPFC.},

abstract = {Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become the major imaging modality to study properties of white matter and the geometry of fiber tracts of the human brain. Clinical studies mostly focus on regional statistics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) derived from tensors. Existing analysis techniques do not sufficiently take into account that the measurements are tensors, and thus require proper interpolation and statistics of tensors, and that regions of interest are fiber tracts with complex spatial geometry. We propose a new framework for quantitative tract-oriented DTI analysis that systematically includes tensor interpolation and averaging, using nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. A new measure of tensor anisotropy, called geodesic anisotropy (GA) is applied and compared with FA. As a result, tracts of interest are represented by the geometry of the medial spine attributed with tensor statistics (average and variance) calculated within cross-sections. Feasibility of our approach is demonstrated on various fiber tracts of a single data set. A validation study, based on six repeated scans of the same subject, assesses the reproducibility of this new DTI data analysis framework. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To elucidate compositional changes of the limbic system with aging, the authors investigated age-related changes of elements in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and fornix and the relationships among elements by direct chemical analysis. After ordinary dissections at Nara Medical University were finished, the hippocampi, dentate gyri, and fornices were resected from identical cerebra of the subjects which consisted of 23 men and 23 women, ranging in age from 70 to 101 years. After ashing with nitric acid and perchloric acid, element contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. The average contents of P, Zn, and Na were significantly less in both the hippocampi and dentate gyri compared with the fornices. It was found that the Ca and Mg contents increased significantly in the hippocampus with aging; the P content increased significantly in the dentate gyrus with aging, whereas the Na content decreased in the dentate gyrus with aging; and the Mg content increased significantly in the fornix with aging. Regarding the relationships among elements, a significant direct correlation between Ca and Fe contents and an extremely significant inverse correlation between P and Zn contents were found in both the hippocampi and dentate gyri. In addition, a significant direct correlation between P and Mg contents was found in both the hippocampi and fornices. Pearson's correlation was used to examine whether there were elements with significant correlation among the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, fornix, and mammillary body. Significant correlations were found in five elements of Ca, P, Mg, Zn, and Fe except for S and Na among the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and mammillary body with one exception. Regarding the fornix, significant correlations were found in two elements of P and Fe between the fornix and hippocampus, dentate gyrus, or mammillary body.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible association of persistent enterovirus (EV) infection with the development of ALS. BACKGROUND: Although ALS is a clinically well-defined motor neuron disease, little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of the sporadic cases. Among the different causes that have been hypothesized, conflicting results have been reported about the possible role of persistent enteroviral infection. METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and direct RT in situ PCR (RT-IS-PCR) were performed in formaldehyde-fixed spinal cord samples of 17 patients with confirmed ALS and 29 control subjects with no history of motor neuron disease. When obtained, PCR products were sequenced subsequently. RESULTS: Using direct RT-IS-PCR, EV nucleic acid sequences were detected in 15 (88.3{\%}) of 17 patients with ALS compared to 1 (3.4{\%}) of 29 control subjects. PCR products were located in neuronal cell bodies of the anterior horns of the spinal cord. The RT-PCR products obtained in 13 of the 17 patients with ALS showed between 94{\%} and 86{\%} homology with echovirus 7 sequences. CONCLUSION: The 88.3{\%} rate of detection of enterovirus (EV) nucleic acids in the neuronal cell bodies within the gray matter of the spinal cord of patients with ALS strongly suggests association between persistent EV RNA and ALS. Further work is required to confirm that the persisting EV sequences we detected are somehow involved in the development of ALS.},

abstract = {Tissue damage, inflammation or injury of the nervous system may result in chronic neuropathic pain characterised by increased sensitivity to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia), the perception of innocuous stimuli as painful (allodynia) and spontaneous pain. Neuropathic pain has been described in about 1{\%} of the US population, is often severely debilitating and largely resistant to treatment. Animal models of peripheral neuropathic pain are now available in which the mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia and allodynia due to nerve injury or nerve inflammation can be analysed. Recently, it has become clear that inflammatory and immune mechanisms both in the periphery and the central nervous system play an important role in neuropathic pain. Infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as activation of resident immune cells in response to nervous system damage, leads to subsequent production and secretion of various inflammatory mediators. These mediators promote neuroimmune activation and can sensitise primary afferent neurones and contribute to pain hypersensitivity. Inflammatory cells such as mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes have all been implicated, as have immune-like glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes. In addition, the immune response plays an important role in demyelinating neuropathies such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which pain is a common symptom, and an animal model of MS-related pain has recently been demonstrated. Here, we will briefly review some of the milestones in research that have led to an increased awareness of the contribution of immune and inflammatory systems to neuropathic pain and then review in more detail the role of immune cells and inflammatory mediators},

abstract = {Research data suggest that the amygdala and some related brain structures modulate the processing of emotional visual stimuli even when they are not consciously perceived. In this study, we examined neural responses to investigate whether and how other brain areas anatomically connected to the amygdala might become activated during both overt and covert presentation of conditioned emotional visual stimuli. In the covert presentation, a conditioned angry face was shown for 15 ms followed by a neutral masking face (CSmask). In the overt condition, an angry face associated with a painful stimulus (CS+), a happy (H) and a neutral face (N) were presented for 75 ms. Based on results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 10 healthy volunteers, we show evidence that a network of brain structures anatomically connected to the amygdala (including the anterior insula, the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus) are involved in the subliminal processing of visual emotional stimuli. Of particular interest was the dissociation between the anterior and posterior insula: the anterior insula responded to both overt and covert presentation of the conditioned stimulus, whereas the posterior insula responded only to the overt presentation of the face associated with a painful electrical stimulation. This response pattern suggests that the anterior insula, the fusiform gyrus and the temporal sulcus cooperate with the amygdala in the unconscious processing of pain-conditioned stimuli.},

There were no significant differences in the plasma levels of 22 amino acids between the two groups. In CSF, there was a significant elevation of the glutamate level in the MND patients (P = 0.008). However, the MND group were heterogeneous with regard to CSF glutamate: 19/31 (61{\%}) had levels within the normal range; eight (26{\%}) had levels more than twice the upper limit of normal ({\textgreater} or = 10 mumol/l) and five (16{\%}) had levels more than seven times normal ({\textgreater} or = 30 mumol/l). In a subset of seven MND patients there was a significant inverse correlation (rs = -0.775, P {\textless} 0.03) between CSF glutamate levels in life and the density of pre-synaptic glutamate re-uptake sites in the lumbar spinal cord measured in a post-mortem autoradiographic study. A possible interpretation of these findings is that an abnormality of glutamate transport may underlie the increase in CSF glutamate. The identification of a subgroup of MND patients with high CSF glutamate levels may be important in evaluating the clinical response to antiglutamate therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Great advances in neuroimaging, intraoperative cranial nerve monitoring, and microsurgical technique have shifted the focus of acoustic neuroma surgery from prolonging life to preserving cranial nerve function in patients. An appreciation of the vascular and cranial nerve microanatomy and the intimate relationship between neurovascular structures and the tumor is essential to achieve optimum results. In this paper the authors analyze the microanatomical variations in location of the facial and cochlear nerves in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) associated with acoustic neuromas and, additionally, describe the frequency of involvement of surrounding neural and vascular structures with acoustic tumors of varying size. The authors base these findings on their experience with 1006 consecutive patients who underwent surgery via a retrosigmoid or translabyrinthine approach. METHODS: Between July 1969 and January 1998, the senior author (D.M.L.) performed surgery in 1022 patients for acoustic neuroma: 705 (69{\%}) via the retrosigmoid (suboccipital); 301 (29{\%}) via the translabyrinthine; and 16 (2{\%}) via the middle fossa approach. Patients undergoing the middle fossa approach were excluded from the study. The remaining 1006 patients were subdivided into three groups based on tumor size: Group I tumors (609 patients [61{\%}]) were smaller than 2.5 cm; Group II tumors (244 patients [24{\%}]) were between 2.5 and 4 cm; and Group III tumors (153 patients [15{\%}]) were larger than 4 cm. The senior author's operative notes were analyzed for each patient. Relevant cranial nerve and vascular "involvement" as well as anatomical location with respect to the tumor in the CPA were noted. "Involvement" was defined as adherence between neurovascular structure and tumor (or capsule), for which surgical dissection was required to free the structure. Seventh and eighth cranial nerve involvement was divided into anterior, posterior, and polar (around the upper or lower pole) locations. Anterior and posterior locations were further subdivided into upper, middle, or lower thirds of the tumor. The most common location of the seventh cranial nerve (facial) was the anterior middle third of the tumor for all groups, although a significant number were found on the anterior superior portion. The posterior location was exceedingly rare ({\textless} 1{\%}). Interestingly, patients with smaller tumors (Group I) had an incidence (3.4{\%}) of the seventh cranial nerve passing through the tumor itself, equal to that of patients with larger tumors. The most common location of the eighth cranial nerve complex was the anterior inferior portion of the tumor. Not surprisingly, larger tumors (Group III) had a higher incidence of involvement of fourth cranial nerve (41{\%}), fifth cranial nerve (100{\%}), ninth-11th cranial nerve complex (99{\%}), and 12th cranial nerve (31{\%}), as well as superior cerebellar artery (79{\%}), anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) trunk (91.5{\%}), AICA branches (100{\%}), posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) trunk (59.5{\%}), PICA branches (79{\%}), and the vertebral artery (VA) (93.5{\%}). A small number of patients in Group III also had AICA (3.3{\%}), PICA (3.3{\%}), or VA (1.3{\%}) vessels within the tumor itself. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the authors show the great variation in anatomical location and involvement of neurovascular structures in the CPA. With this knowledge, they present certain technical lessons that may be useful in preserving nerve function during surgery and, in doing so, hope to provide neurosurgeons and neurootologists with valuable information that may help to achieve optimum outcomes in patients},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to explore whether the neural substrates demonstrated in brain imaging studies on experimentally induced pain are involved in the perception of chronic neuropathic pain. We investigated the cerebral representation of chronic lateralised ongoing pain in patients with painful mononeuropathy (PMN, i.e., pain in the distribution of a nerve, neuralgia) with positron emission tomography (PET), using regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as an index for neuronal activity. Eight patients (29-53 years) with PMN in the lower extremity (4 in the right, 4 in the left) were recruited. Paired comparisons of rCBF were made between the patient's habitual pain (HP) state and the pain alleviated (PA) state following a successful regional nerve block (RNB) with lidocaine. The ongoing neuropathic pain resulted in activation of bilateral anterior insula, posterior parietal, lateral inferior prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices as well as the posterior sector of the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Brodmann area (BA) 24, regardless of the side of PMN. In addition, a reduction in rCBF was noted in the contralateral posterior thalamus. No significant change of rCBF was detected in the somatosensory areas, i.e., SI and SII. The cerebral activation pattern, while addressing the differences between the HP and PA states, emphasises the affective-motivational dimension in chronic ongoing neuropathic pain. The striking preferential activation of the right ACC (BA 24), regardless of the side of the PMN, not only confirms that the ACC participates in the sensorial/affectional aspect of the pain experience but also suggests a possible right hemispheric lateralisation of the ACC for affective processing in chronic ongoing neuropathic pain. Our data suggests that the brain employs different central mechanisms for chronic neuropathic pain and experimentally induced acute pain, respectively.},

abstract = {OBJECT: In this paper, the authors introduce a method of noninvasive anatomical analysis of the facial nerve-vestibulocochlear nerve complex and the depiction of the variable vascular relationships by using 3D volume visualization. With this technique, a detailed spatial representation of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves was obtained. Patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS) resulting from neurovascular compression (NVC) were examined. METHODS: A total of 25 patients (13 males and 12 females) with HFS underwent 3D visualization using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with 3D constructive interference in a steady state (CISS). Each data set was segmented and visualized with respect to the individual neurovascular relationships by direct volume rendering. Segmentation and visualization of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves were performed with reference to their root exit zone (REZ), as well as proximal and distal segments including corresponding blood vessels. The 3D visualizations were interactively compared with the intraoperative situation during microvascular decompression (MVD) to verify the results with the observed microneurosurgical anatomy. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 20 underwent MVD (80{\%}). Microvascular details were recorded on the affected and unaffected sides. On the affected sides, the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) was the most common causative vessel. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery, vertebral artery, internal auditory artery, and veins at the REZ of the facial nerve (the seventh cranial nerve) were also found to cause vascular contacts to the REZ of the facial nerve. In addition to this, the authors identified three distinct types of NVC within the REZ of the facial nerve at the affected sides. The authors analyzed the varying courses of the vessels on the unaffected sides. There were no bilateral clinical symptoms of HFS and no bilateral vascular compression of the REZ of the facial nerve. The authors discovered that the AICA is the most common vessel that interferes with the proximal and distal portions of the facial nerve without any contact between vessels and the REZ of the facial nerve on the unaffected sides. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional visualization by direct volume rendering of 3D CISS MR imaging data offers the opportunity of noninvasive exploration and anatomical categorization of the facial nerve-vestibulocochlear nerve complex. Furthermore, it proves to be advantageous in establishing the diagnosis and guiding neurosurgical procedures by representing original MR imaging patient data in a 3D fashion. This modality provides an excellent overview of the entire neurovascular relationship of the cerebellopontine angle in each case},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The oculomotor cistern (OMC) is a small CSF-filled dural cuff that invaginates into the cavernous sinus, surrounding the third cranial nerve (CNIII). It is used by neurosurgeons to mobilize CNIII during cavernous sinus surgery. In this article, we present the OMC imaging spectrum as delineated on 1.5T and 3T MR images and demonstrate its involvement in cavernous sinus pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 78 high-resolution screening MR images of the internal auditory canals (IAC) obtained for sensorineural hearing loss. Cistern length and diameter were measured. Fifty randomly selected whole-brain MR images were evaluated to determine how often the OMC can be visualized on routine scans. Three volunteers underwent dedicated noncontrast high-resolution MR imaging for optimal OMC visualization. RESULTS: One or both OMCs were visualized on 75{\%} of IAC screening studies. The right cistern length averaged 4.2 +/- 3.2 mm; the opening diameter (the porus) averaged 2.2 +/- 0.8 mm. The maximal length observed was 13.1 mm. The left cistern length averaged 3.0 +/- 1.7 mm; the porus diameter averaged 2.1 +/-1.0 mm, with a maximal length of 5.9 mm. The OMC was visualized on 64{\%} of routine axial T2-weighted brain scans. CONCLUSION: The OMC is an important neuroradiologic and surgical landmark, which can be routinely identified on dedicated thin-section high-resolution MR images. It can also be identified on nearly two thirds of standard whole-brain MR images},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the many reasons why lesional surgery for movement disorders has been more or less abandoned may have been the difficulty in predicting the shape and size of the stereotactic radiofrequency (RF) lesion. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the contribution of various RF coagulation parameters towards the volume of pallidotomies and thalamotomies. METHODS: The relationship between temperature of coagulation, length of coagulated area and duration of coagulation on the one hand, and lesion volume on the other was retrospectively evaluated. Lesion diameters were measured on stereotactic thin-slice CT and MRI scans, and volumes of lesions were calculated concerning 36 pallidotomies and 14 thalamotomies in 46 patients who were operated using the same RF generator and same RF electrode. RESULTS: The coagulation temperature, length of coagulated area and duration of coagulation were all correlated to the lesion volume. However, for a given length of coagulated area, the lesion´s size was most strongly influenced by the temperature. Despite this clear correlation, and the relatively homogenous coagulation parameters, the lesions' volumes were markedly scattered. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of the stereotactic RF lesions could be correlated with the coagulation parameters, especially the temperature, at a group level, but could not be predicted in individual patients based solely on the RF coagulation parameters.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cross-sectional associations among self-reported weekly strenuous exercise bouts, anxiety sensitivity, and their interaction with pain catastrophizing and pain responses to the cold pressor task (CPT) in healthy, ethnically diverse young adults (n = 79). Exercise involvement has been shown to have hypoalgesic effects and cognitive factors may partially explain this effect. Particularly, alterations in pain catastrophizing have been found to mediate the positive pain outcomes of multidisciplinary treatments incorporating exercise. Further, recent evidence suggests that exercise involvement and anxiety sensitivity may act together, as interacting factors, to exert an effect on catastrophizing and pain outcomes; however, further research is needed to clarify the nature of this interaction. METHODS: Before the CPT, participants were asked to complete the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index. After the CPT, participants completed a modified version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire. RESULTS: At a high level of anxiety sensitivity, controlling for depressive symptoms, CPT immersion time, and sex differences, a bias-corrected (BC), bootstrapped confidence interval revealed that pain catastrophizing significantly mediated the relationship between self-reported weekly strenuous exercise bouts and pain response (95{\%} BC Confidence Interval = -9.558, -0.800 with 1000 resamples). At intermediate and low levels of anxiety sensitivity, no significant mediation effects were found. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that, for pain catastrophizing to mediate the strenuous exercise-pain response relation, individuals must possess a high level of anxiety sensitivity},

abstract = {Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in the living animal that can be translated to human can provide extremely useful tools for monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to promote nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance based technique, provides image contrast for nerve tracts and can be applied serially on the same subject with potential to monitor nerve fiber content. In this study, we examined the use of ex vivo high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral nerves in mice and correlated the MRI findings with electrophysiology and histology. DTI was done on sciatic nerves with crush, without crush, and after complete transection in different mouse strains. DTI measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in segments of uninjured and crushed/transected nerves and correlated with morphometry. A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a comparable pattern of regeneration in different mice strains. FA values were significantly lower in completely denervated nerve segments compared to uninjured sciatic nerve and this signal was restored toward normal in regenerating nerve segments (crushed nerves). Histology data indicate that the FA values and the parallel diffusivity showed a positive correlation with the total number of regenerating axons. These studies suggest that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in mouse models and provide basis for further development of imaging technology for application to living animals and humans},

An emerging concept is that, instead, pain might emerge from the coordinated activity of an integrated brain network. In support of this view, Woo and colleagues present evidence that distinct brain networks support the subjective changes in pain that result from nociceptive input and self-directed cognitive modulation. This evidence for the sensitivity of distinct neural subsystems to different aspects of pain opens up the way to more formal computational network theories of pain.},

abstract = {Pain is a diverse sensory and emotional experience that likely involves activation of numerous regions of the brain. Yet, many of these areas are also implicated in the processing of nonpainful somatosensory information. In order to better characterize the processing of pain within the human brain, activation produced by noxious stimuli was compared with that produced by robust innocuous stimuli. Painful heat (47-48 degrees C), nonpainful vibratory (110 Hz), and neutral control (34 degrees C) stimuli were applied to the left forearm of right-handed male subjects. Activation of regions within the diencephalon and telencephalon was evaluated by measuring regional cerebral blood flow using positron emission tomography (15O-water-bolus method). Painful stimulation produced contralateral activation in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII), anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, the supplemental motor area of the frontal cortex, and thalamus. Vibrotactile stimulation produced activation in contralateral SI, and bilaterally in SII and posterior insular cortices. A direct comparison of pain and vibrotactile stimulation revealed that both stimuli produced activation in similar regions of SI and SII, regions long thought to be involved in basic somatosensory processing. In contrast, painful stimuli were significantly more effective in activating the anterior insula, a region heavily linked with both somatosensory and limbic systems. Such connections may provide one route through which nociceptive input may be integrated with memory in order to allow a full appreciation of the meaning and dangers of painful stimuli. These data reveal that pain-related activation, although predominantly contralateral in distribution, is more widely dispersed across both cortical and thalamic regions than that produced during innocuous vibrotactile stimulation. This distributed cerebral activation reflects the complex nature of pain, involving discriminative, affective, autonomic, and motoric components. Furthermore, the high degree of interconnectivity among activated regions may account for the difficulty of eliminating pathological pain with discrete CNS lesions.},

abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop an integrated diffusion map (iDM) for evaluation of diffusion properties, including the mean diffusivity and diffusion anisotropy concurrently. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed integrated diffusion map consisted of trace and the deviation tensor. It measures the diffusion distributions from a region of interest. Diffusion tensor imaging was acquired from nine healthy volunteers and four patients with acoustic neuroma before and 3 months after the stereotactic radiosurgery. Five regions of interest were selected from healthy subjects and the whole tumor from the patients. The diffusion properties were analyzed in the proposed integrated diffusion map. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, iDM showed different distributions in regions of interest that can lead to cluster segmentation. In monitoring the treatment response, the number of pixels with meaningful changes in iDM is 12.5{\%} compared to 32.37{\%} in apparent diffusion coefficient and 16.67{\%} in fractional anisotropy. It suggested the effect from radiation therapy might affect the anisotropic diffusion. The interpretation of the diffusion properties, such as changes in mean diffusivity and anisotropy, should be treated in an integrated method. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated diffusion map can be used to analyze the diffusion properties in a comprehensive manner.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has the ability to map neuronal architecture by estimating the 3D diffusion displacement within fibrous brain structures. This approach has non-invasively been demonstrated in the human brain with diffusion tensor tractography. Despite its valuable application in neuroscience and clinical studies however, it faces an inherent limit in mapping fiber tracts through areas with intervoxel incoherence. Recent advances in high angular resolution diffusion imaging have surpassed this limit and have the ability to resolve the complex fiber intercrossing within each MR voxel. To connect the fiber tracts from a multi-fiber system, this study proposed a modified fiber assignment using the continuous tracking (MFACT) algorithm and a tracking browser to propagate tracts along complex diffusion profiles. The Q-ball imaging method was adopted to acquire the diffusion displacements. Human motor pathways with seed points from the internal capsule, motor cortex, and pons were studied respectively. The results were consistent with known anatomy and demonstrated the promising potential of the MFACT method in mapping the complex neuronal architecture in the human brain.},

abstract = {Single unit microelectrode recordings were obtained under local anesthesia in 5 patients who underwent placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes in the anterior thalamic nucleus for control of intractable epilepsy. Of the 261 neurons recorded, 145 were in the anterior nucleus (AN), with the remainder ventral to AN in nucleus cucularis and dorsal dorsomedian nucleus (DM). 126 of the 261 neurons fired in bursts, and of these, 74 cells were analyzed in greater detail to characterize their bursting pattern. The bursts in 70{\%} of the bursting neurons were characterized as low-threshold calcium spike (LTS) mediated bursts, on the basis of their intraburst firing pattern. The bursts of the remainder, although similar to LTS bursts, did not fulfil all of the criteria for an LTS burst and were termed atypical bursting cells. LTS and atypical bursting cells were found both within AN and in the nucleus cucularis and dorsal DM. The LTS bursting observed in these patients may be due to the altered electrophysiological state of the patients studied since LTS bursting in thalamus is usually only observed during sleep. This study describes for the first time the properties of this nucleus in humans and may be important in furthering our knowledge of thalamic mechanisms of epileptogenesis.},

This technique is applied to the estimation of parameters in the diffusion tensor model, and also to a simple partial volume model of diffusion. In both cases the parameters of interest include parameters defining local fiber direction. A technique is then presented for using these density functions to estimate global connectivity (i.e., the probability of the existence of a connection through the data field, between any two distant points), allowing for the quantification of belief in tractography results. This technique is then applied to the estimation of the cortical connectivity of the human thalamus. The resulting connectivity distributions correspond well with predictions from invasive tracer methods in nonhuman primate.},

abstract = {We describe a novel scalable clustering framework for streamlines obtained from diffusion tractography. Clustering is an attractive means of segmenting a large set of streamlines into anatomically relevant bundles. For most existing methods, however, the large datasets produced in high resolution or multiple subject studies are problematical. To achieve good scalability, our method repeatedly divides the data into subsets, which are then partitioned using hierarchical clustering. A final partition is obtained by recombining the subsets. In addition, the recombination scheme provides a consistency measure for cluster assignment of individual streamlines, which is used to clean up the final result. The clusters have good anatomical plausibility and we show that three clusters corresponding to the three known segments of the arcuate fasciculus show excellent agreement with literature. A major advantage of the method is the fact that it can find clusters in datasets of essentially arbitrary size. This fact is exploited to find consistent clusters in concatenated tractography data from multiple subjects. We expect the identification of bundles across subjects to be an important application of the method.},

abstract = {In vivo functional imaging by means of positron emission tomography (PET) is the sole method for providing a quantitative measurement of mu-, kappa and delta-opioid receptor-mediated signalling in the central nervous system. During the last two decades, measurements of changes to the regional brain opioidergic neuronal activation--mediated by endogenously produced opioid peptides, or exogenously administered opioid drugs--have been conducted in numerous chronic pain conditions, in epilepsy, as well as by stimulant- and opioidergic drugs. Although several PET-tracers have been used clinically for depiction and quantification of the opioid receptors changes, the underlying mechanisms for regulation of changes to the availability of opioid receptors are still unclear. After a presentation of the general signalling mechanisms of the opioid receptor system relevant for PET, a critical survey of the pharmacological properties of some currently available PET-tracers is presented. Clinical studies performed with different PET ligands are also reviewed and the compound-dependent findings are summarized. An outlook is given concluding with the tailoring of tracer properties, in order to facilitate for a selective addressment of dynamic changes to the availability of a single subclass, in combination with an optimization of the quantification framework are essentials for further progress in the field of in vivo opioid receptor imaging.},

@article{Gallese2003,
abstract = {Starting from a neurobiological standpoint, I will propose that our capacity to understand others as intentional agents, far from being exclusively dependent upon mentalistic/linguistic abilities, be deeply grounded in the relational nature of our interactions with the world. According to this hypothesis, an implicit, prereflexive form of understanding of other individuals is based on the strong sense of identity binding us to them. We share with our conspecifics a multiplicity of states that include actions, sensations and emotions. A new conceptual tool able to capture the richness of the experiences we share with others will be introduced: the shared manifold of intersubjectivity. I will posit that it is through this shared manifold that it is possible for us to recognize other human beings as similar to us. It is just because of this shared manifold that intersubjective communication and ascription of intentionality become possible. It will be argued that the same neural structures that are involved in processing and controlling executed actions, felt sensations and emotions are also active when the same actions, sensations and emotions are to be detected in others. It therefore appears that a whole range of different "mirror matching mechanisms" may be present in our brain. This matching mechanism, constituted by mirror neurons originally discovered and described in the domain of action, could well be a basic organizational feature of our brain, enabling our rich and diversified intersubjective experiences. This perspective is in a position to offer a global approach to the understanding of the vulnerability to major psychoses such as schizophrenia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: Several studies have examined structural brain changes associated with chronic pain syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but study sample sizes have been small and heterogeneous. METHODS: We used magnetic resonance imaging-based techniques, voxel-based morphometry, and cortical thickness analysis to examine brain anatomical differences in a relatively large, tightly screened sample of IBS patients (n = 55); we compared data with that from healthy persons (controls; n = 48). RESULTS: IBS was associated with decreased gray matter density (GMD) in widespread areas of the brain, including medial prefrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, ventral striatum, and thalamus. Compared with controls, we observed increased GMD in patients with IBS in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as trends in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, (para)hippocampus, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In accounting for anxiety and depression, we found that several of the regions involved in affective processing no longer differed between patients with IBS and controls, whereas the differences in prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices remained. The areas of decreased GMD associated with IBS were largely consistent across clinical subgroups, based on predominant bowel habit and pain predominance of symptoms. No overall or regional differences were observed in cortical thickness between patients with IBS and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in density of gray matter among regions involved in cognitive/evaluative functions are specifically observed in patients with IBS, whereas changes in other areas of the brain can be explained by levels of anxiety and depression},

While studies produced until five years ago were mostly addressed at identifying lesions of the nociceptive system, more recent papers used LEPs as an instrumental tool for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. LEPs have also proved useful in demonstrating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying different types of neuropathic pain (e.g., paroxystic and ongoing neuropathic pain). This is of utmost importance, as pain treatment should take physiopathological mechanisms, rather than etiology into account. Although there are still some limits for the routine use of LEPs as a diagnostic tool, this review of the literature demonstrates that LEP recording has become mandatory for the functional assessment of patients with hypoalgesia or neuropathic pain.},

abstract = {Pain is common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), but estimates of its prevalence have varied widely. The literature describing pain in MS patients spans four decades and has employed a range of different methodologies. We undertook a systematic review in order to summarize current understanding of the association between MS and pain and provide a basis for the design and interpretation of future studies. The point prevalence of pain in patients with MS is nearly 50{\%}, and approximately 75{\%} of patients report having had pain within one month of assessment. Pain adversely affects most aspects of health-related quality of life, including functional domains such as the ability to work. The presence of pain in patients with MS is associated with increased age, duration of illness, depression, degree of functional impairment, and fatigue. Several different types of pain are found in patients with MS, including extremity pain, trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, painful tonic spasms, back pain, and headache. Putative mechanisms of pain in patients with MS are discussed, and a classification of pain in MS is proposed. Few randomized clinical trials of treatments for MS pain have been conducted, and the limitations of current knowledge regarding approaches for treating MS pain are discussed. Suggestions for future studies that would increase understanding of the natural history, mechanisms, and treatment of pain in patients with MS are presented.},

This RPE hypothesis provides a compelling theoretical framework for understanding DA function in reward learning and addiction. New studies support a causal role for DA-mediated RPE activity in promoting learning about natural reward; however, this question has not been explicitly tested in the context of drug addiction. In this review, we integrate theoretical models with experimental findings on the activity of DA systems, and on the causal role of specific neuronal projections and cell types, to provide a circuit-based framework for probing DA-RPE function in addiction. By examining error-encoding DA neurons in the neural network in which they are embedded, hypotheses regarding circuit-level adaptations that possibly contribute to pathological error signaling and addiction can be formulated and tested.},

To define the role of CREB in distinct memory processes, we derived transgenic mice with an inducible and reversible CREB repressor by fusing CREBS133A to a tamoxifen (TAM)-dependent mutant of an estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (LBD). We found that CREB is crucial for the consolidation of long-term conditioned fear memories, but not for encoding, storage or retrieval of these memories. Our studies also showed that CREB is required for the stability of reactivated or retrieved conditioned fear memories. Although the transcriptional processes necessary for the stability of initial and reactivated memories differ, CREB is required for both. The findings presented here delineate the memory processes that require CREB and demonstrate the power of LBD-inducible transgenic systems in the study of complex cognitive processes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether short echo-time (TE) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) can detect in vivo differences in signal intensities of specific metabolites in the medulla of patients with ALS compared with healthy individuals and whether these metabolites could be useful surrogate markers of disease. BACKGROUND: 1H-MRSI can detect N-acetylaspartate + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (abbreviated NAx), which is localized to neurons, and glutamate (Glu) + glutamine (Gln), abbreviated Glx, which may be important in ALS pathogenesis. The medulla is an ideal region to study ALS because of its high density of nuclei and fiber tracts that frequently undergo degeneration, even when more rostral brain regions show minimal pathology. METHODS: Ten patients with ALS and seven healthy control subjects underwent short TE 1H-MRSI on a 1.5 T clinical imaging system. Signal intensities of NAx and Glx were normalized to creatine-phosphocreatine and compared between groups. RESULTS: Compared with normal subjects, the medulla of patients with ALS had 17{\%} lower NAx (p = 0.03) and 55{\%} higher Glx (p = 0.02) signals. Bulbar symptoms, represented by the ALS Functional Rating Scale, correlated with Glx (r = -0.68, p = 0.03) but not NAx (r = 0.22, p = 0.53). CONCLUSION: There is in vivo 1H-MRSI evidence of neuronal degeneration or loss and excess Glu + Gln in the medulla of patients with ALS. Although this cross-sectional study cannot identify which change occurred first, the higher Glx signal in the medulla of patients with more dysarthria and dysphagia is consistent with the hypothesis of Glu excitotoxicity in ALS pathogenesis. Longitudinal 1H-MRSI studies of the medulla (and other brain regions) in more patients with ALS are required to confirm these findings and to determine whether such metabolite changes will be useful in monitoring disease progression, in clinical diagnosis, and in understanding the pathogenesis of ALS.},

OBJECTIVE:: Using the bi-commissural anterior commissure (AC) -PC reference system, this study aimed to define a template and design a method for the 3-D reconstruction of the human insula that may be used at an individual level during stereotactic surgery. METHODS:: MRI-based morphometric analysis was performed on 100 cerebral cortices with normal insular based on a three step procedure: Step 1: AC-PC reference system-based reconstruction of the insula from the 1 mm thick 3-D-T1-MRI slices. Step 2: Digitalization and superposition of the data obtained in the 3 spatial planes. Step 3: Representation of pixels as colors on a scale corresponding to the probability of localization of each insular anatomical component. RESULTS:: The morphometric analysis of the insula confirmed our previously reported findings of a more complex shape delimited by 4 peri-insular sulci. A very significant correlation between the coordinates of the main insular structures and the length of AC-PC was demonstrated. This close correlation allowed us to develop a method that allows the 3-D reconstruction of the insula from MRI slices and only requires the localization of AC and PC. This process defines an area deemed to contain insula with 100{\%} probability. CONCLUSION:: This 3-D reconstruction of the insula should be useful to improve the localization of it and other cortical areas and allow the differentiation of insular cortex from the opercular cortex},

abstract = {The SII area and the posterior insular region are both activated by thermal stimuli in functional imaging studies. However, controversy remains as to a possible differential encoding of thermal intensity by each of these 2 contiguous areas. Using CO(2) laser stimulations, we analyzed the modifications induced by increasing thermal energy on evoked potentials recorded with electrodes implanted within SII and posterior insula in patients referred for presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. Although increasing stimulus intensities enhanced both SII and insular responses, the "dynamics" of their respective amplitude changes were different. SII responses were able to encode gradually the intensity of stimuli from sensory threshold up to a level next to pain threshold but tended to show a ceiling effect for higher painful intensities. In contrast, the posterior insular cortex failed to detect nonnoxious laser pulses but reliably encoded stimulus intensity variations at painful levels, without showing saturation effects for intensities above pain threshold. According to these results, one can assume that insular cortex could be more involved in the triggering of affective recognition of, and motor reaction to, noxious stimuli, whereas SII would be more dedicated to finer-grain discrimination of stimulus intensity, from nonpainful to painful levels.},

abstract = {Noninvasive cortical stimulation (NICS) can produce analgesic effects by means of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Such effects have been demonstrated on chronic ongoing pain, as in acute provoked pain. The investigation of induced changes in the perception of experimental pain by NICS could help clinicians and researchers to better understand the mechanisms of action involved with these techniques and the role played by the cortex in the integration of nociceptive information. This review presents current literature data on the modulation of experimental pain perception by cortical stimulation. The observations found that NICS analgesic effects depend on the method used to provoke pain (referring to the type of nerve fibers and neural circuits that are recruited to mediate pain) and the parameters of cortical stimulation (especially the nature of the cortical target). The motor cortex (precentral cortical area) is the most widely used target for pain modulation. However, other targets, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, could be of particular interest to modulate various components of pain. Further developments in NICS techniques, such as image-guided navigated brain stimulation, might lead to improvement in the beneficial effects of NICS on pain. Finally, we discuss whether the results obtained in experimental pain can be transposed to the problem of chronic pain and whether they can be used to optimize cortical stimulation therapy for pain disorders},

abstract = {Prior anterograde tracing work identified somatotopically organized lamina I trigemino- and spinothalamic terminations in a cytoarchitectonically distinct portion of posterolateral thalamus of the macaque monkey, named the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo; Craig [2004] J. Comp. Neurol. 477:119-148). Microelectrode recordings from clusters of selectively thermoreceptive or nociceptive neurons were used to guide precise microinjections of various tracers in VMpo. A prior report (Craig and Zhang [2006] J. Comp. Neurol. 499:953-964) described retrograde tracing results, which confirmed the selective lamina I input to VMpo and the anteroposterior (head to foot) topography. The present report describes the results of microinjections of anterograde tracers placed at different levels in VMpo, based on the anteroposterior topographic organization of selectively nociceptive units and clusters over nearly the entire extent of VMpo. Each injection produced dense, patchy terminal labeling in a single coherent field within a distinct granular cortical area centered in the fundus of the superior limiting sulcus. The terminations were distributed with a consistent anteroposterior topography over the posterior half of the superior limiting sulcus. These observations demonstrate a specific VMpo projection area in dorsal posterior insular cortex that provides the basis for a somatotopic representation of selectively nociceptive lamina I spinothalamic activity. These results also identify the VMpo terminal area as the posterior half of interoceptive cortex; the anterior half receives input from the vagal-responsive and gustatory neurons in the basal part of the ventral medial nucleus.},

abstract = {Episodic migraine (EM) may evolve into disabling chronic migraine (CM). The progression is elusive but may be underpinned by central excitability change. Recently, several studies have investigated visual cortex excitability in different migraine disorders using magnetoencephalography, a technique superior to traditional scalp electroencephalography in measuring cortical excitability. These studies replicated the earlier visual evoked potential findings that the visual excitability in EM is dynamically modulated, featured by an interictal lack and ictal recovery of the habituation (ie, response attenuation to repetitive stimulations) in visual evoked responses. Moreover, the excitability in CM presented with a persistent ictal-like dysfunction in interictal recordings, which shifted in tandem to the pattern characteristic of EM after a clinical remission from CM to EM. A sustained potentiation (response augmentation) further differentiates CM with the rare phenotype of persistent visual aura from EM or CM alone. To conclude, visual cortex excitability is a potential biomarker of migraine disorders and its neuroplasticity is associated with CM evolution or remission.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic dysregulation can cause motor dysfunction, but the mechanisms underlying dopamine-related motor disorders remain under debate. We used an inducible and reversible pharmacogenetic approach in dopamine transporter knockout mice to investigate the simultaneous activity of neuronal ensembles in the dorsolateral striatum and primary motor cortex during hyperdopaminergia (∼500{\%} of controls) with hyperkinesia, and after rapid and profound dopamine depletion ({\textless}0.2{\%}) with akinesia in the same animal. Surprisingly, although most cortical and striatal neurons (∼70{\%}) changed firing rate during the transition between dopamine-related hyperkinesia and akinesia, the overall cortical firing rate remained unchanged. Conversely, neuronal oscillations and ensemble activity coordination within and between cortex and striatum did change rapidly between these periods. During hyperkinesia, corticostriatal activity became largely asynchronous, while during dopamine-depletion the synchronicity increased. Thus, dopamine-related disorders like Parkinson's disease may not stem from changes in the overall levels of cortical activity, but from dysfunctional activity coordination in corticostriatal circuits. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Diffusion tensor imaging has previously been used to define large white-matter tracts in the living human brain, but this technique has had limited success in tracing pathways into gray matter. Here we identified specific connections between human thalamus and cortex using a novel probabilistic tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data. Classification of thalamic gray matter based on cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct subregions whose locations correspond to nuclei described previously in histological studies. The connections that we found between thalamus and cortex were similar to those reported for non-human primates and were reproducible between individuals. Our results provide the first quantitative demonstration of reliable inference of anatomical connectivity between human gray matter structures using diffusion data and the first connectivity-based segmentation of gray matter},

The lateral ventricular system was divided into the anterior horn, temporal horn, and dorsal lateral ventricle. Schizophrenic patients had larger left anterior and temporal horns than the normal volunteers. Size of the left anterior and temporal horn in SPD patients was intermediate between those of normal volunteers and schizophrenic patients and differed significantly from schizophrenic patients. The left-minus-right difference was larger in schizophrenic patients than in normal volunteers or SPD patients. Thus, in their structural brain characteristics, as well as in their clinical symptomatology, SPD patients evidence, in attenuated form, abnormalities resembling those found in full-fledged schizophrenia.

abstract = {A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Functional results after surgery for acoustic neuromas that have little or no growth within the internal auditory canal are controversial, because these medial tumors can grow to a considerable size within the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) before symptoms occur. METHODS: A prospective study was designed to evaluate the surgical implications of the course of the facial nerve within the CPA on medial acoustic neuromas. This study included a consecutive series of 22 patients with medial acoustic neuromas (mean size 32 mm, range 17-52 mm) who underwent surgery via a suboccipitolateral approach between 1997 and 2001. All patients underwent pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and preoperative electromyography (EMG). Evaluation was based on continuous intraoperative EMG monitoring and video recordings of the procedure. All patients were reevaluated at a mean of 19 months (6-50 months) postsurgery. Preoperative evaluation of facial nerve function revealed House-Brackmann Grade I in six, Grade II in 14, and Grade III in two patients. During surgery a distinct splitting of the nerve at the root exit zone through its intracisternal course was seen in eight patients and documented by selective electrical stimulation. The facial nerve was separated into a smaller portion that ran cranially and parallel to the trigeminal nerve, and a larger portion on the anterior tumor surface. Both components joined anterior to the porus without major spreading of the nerve bundle. In two cases the nerve was found on the posterior surface of the cranial tumor. In one case the facial nerve entered the porus of the canal at its lower part, obtaining the expected anatomical position proximally within the middle portion of the canal. An anterior cranial, middle (five cases each), or caudal course (two cases) was seen in the remaining patients. After surgery, facial nerve function deteriorated in most cases; on follow-up evaluation House-Brackmann Grade I was found in 11, Grades II and III in 10, and Grade V in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The facial nerve requires special attention in surgery for medial acoustic neuromas, because an atypical course of the nerve can be expected in the majority of cases. A split course of the nerve was found in 36{\%} of the cases presented. Meticulous use of intraoperative facial nerve stimulation and continuous monitoring ensures facial nerve integrity and offers good functional results in patients with medial acoustic neuromas},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent data suggests that in chronic pain there are changes in gray matter consistent with decreased brain volume, indicating that the disease process may produce morphological changes in the brains of those affected. However, no study has evaluated cortical thickness in relation to specific functional changes in evoked pain. In this study we sought to investigate structural (gray matter thickness) and functional (blood oxygenation dependent level - BOLD) changes in cortical regions of precisely matched patients with chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) affecting the right maxillary (V2) division of the trigeminal nerve. The model has a number of advantages including the evaluation of specific changes that can be mapped to known somatotopic anatomy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cortical regions were chosen based on sensory (Somatosensory cortex (SI and SII), motor (MI) and posterior insula), or emotional (DLPFC, Frontal, Anterior Insula, Cingulate) processing of pain. Both structural and functional (to brush-induced allodynia) scans were obtained and averaged from two different imaging sessions separated by 2-6 months in all patients. Age and gender-matched healthy controls were also scanned twice for cortical thickness measurement. Changes in cortical thickness of TNP patients were frequently colocalized and correlated with functional allodynic activations, and included both cortical thickening and thinning in sensorimotor regions, and predominantly thinning in emotional regions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, such patterns of cortical thickness suggest a dynamic functionally-driven plasticity of the brain. These structural changes, which correlated with the pain duration, age-at-onset, pain intensity and cortical activity, may be specific targets for evaluating therapeutic interventions.},

In this study, the behavior of an algorithm for white matter tractography is examined. The algorithm, called TEND, uses the entire diffusion tensor to deflect the estimated fiber trajectory. Simulations and imaging experiments on in vivo human brains were performed to investigate the behavior of the tractography algorithm. The simulations show that the deflection term is less sensitive than the major eigenvector to image noise. In the human brain imaging experiments, estimated tracts were generated in corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus.

abstract = {We propose a regularized, fast, and robust analytical solution for the Q-ball imaging (QBI) reconstruction of the orientation distribution function (ODF) together with its detailed validation and a discussion on its benefits over the state-of-the-art. Our analytical solution is achieved by modeling the raw high angular resolution diffusion imaging signal with a spherical harmonic basis that incorporates a regularization term based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on the unit sphere. This leads to an elegant mathematical simplification of the Funk-Radon transform which approximates the ODF. We prove a new corollary of the Funk-Hecke theorem to obtain this simplification. Then, we show that the Laplace-Beltrami regularization is theoretically and practically better than Tikhonov regularization. At the cost of slightly reducing angular resolution, the Laplace-Beltrami regularization reduces ODF estimation errors and improves fiber detection while reducing angular error in the ODF maxima detected. Finally, a careful quantitative validation is performed against ground truth from synthetic data and against real data from a biological phantom and a human brain dataset. We show that our technique is also able to recover known fiber crossings in the human brain and provides the practical advantage of being up to 15 times faster than original numerical QBI method.},

abstract = {Aging and age-related diseases have negative impact on the hippocampus (HC), which is crucial for such age-sensitive functions as memory formation, maintenance, and retrieval. We examined age differences in hippocampal subfield volumes in 10 younger and 19 older adults, and association of those volumes with memory performance in the older participants. We manually measured volumes of HC regions CA1 and CA2 (CA1-2), sectors CA3 and CA4 plus dentate gyrus (CA3-4/DG), subiculum, and the entorhinal cortex using a contrast-optimized high-resolution PD-weighted MRI sequence. Although, as in previous reports, the volume of one region (CA1-2) was larger in the young, the difference was due to the presence of hypertensive subjects among the older adults. Among older participants, increased false alarm rate in an associative recognition memory task was linked to reduced CA3-4/DG volume. We discuss the role of the DG in pattern separation and the formation of discrete memory representations.},

abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete - i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

abstract = {Objective: To clarify the physiological and behavioral boundaries between locked-in (LIS) and the completely locked-in state (CLIS) (no voluntary eye movements, no communication possible) through electrophysiological data and to secure brain-computer-interface (BCI) communication. Methods: Electromyography from facial muscles, external anal sphincter (EAS), electrooculography and electrocorticographic data during different psychophysiological tests were acquired to define electrophysiological differences in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient with an intracranially implanted grid of 112 electrodes for nine months while the patient passed from the LIS to the CLIS. Results: At the very end of the LIS there was no facial muscle activity, nor external anal sphincter but eye control. Eye movements were slow and lasted for short periods only. During CLIS event related brain potentials (ERP) to passive limb movements and auditory stimuli were recorded, vibrotactile stimulation of different body parts resulted in no ERP response. Conclusions: The results presented contradict the commonly accepted assumption that the EAS is the last remaining muscle under voluntary control and demonstrate complete loss of eye movements in CLIS. The eye muscle was shown to be the last muscle group under voluntary control. The findings suggest ALS as a multisystem disorder, even affecting afferent sensory pathways. Significance: Auditory and proprioceptive brain-computer-interface (BCI) systems are the only remaining communication channels in CLIS. ?? 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new neural structure called FusionNet, which extends existing attention approaches from three perspectives. First, it puts forward a novel concept of "history of word" to characterize attention information from the lowest word-level embedding up to the highest semantic-level representation. Second, it introduces an improved attention scoring function that better utilizes the "history of word" concept. Third, it proposes a fully-aware multi-level attention mechanism to capture the complete information in one text (such as a question) and exploit it in its counterpart (such as context or passage) layer by layer. We apply FusionNet to the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and it achieves the first position for both single and ensemble model on the official SQuAD leaderboard at the time of writing (Oct. 4th, 2017). Meanwhile, we verify the generalization of FusionNet with two adversarial SQuAD datasets and it sets up the new state-of-the-art on both datasets: on AddSent, FusionNet increases the best F1 metric from 46.6{\%} to 51.4{\%}; on AddOneSent, FusionNet boosts the best F1 metric from 56.0{\%} to 60.7{\%}.},

abstract = {Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g. 224x224) input image. This requirement is "artificial" and may hurt the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with a more principled pooling strategy, "spatial pyramid pooling", to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. By removing the fixed-size limitation, we can improve all CNN-based image classification methods in general. Our SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the datasets of ImageNet 2012, Pascal VOC 2007, and Caltech101. The power of SPP-net is more significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method computes convolutional features 30-170x faster than the recent leading method R-CNN (and 24-64x faster overall), while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: This study explored the functional connectivity between brain regions implicated in the default mode network, the sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1), and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS/MIP) at rest in patients with complex regional pain syndrome. It also investigated how possible alterations are associated with neuropathic pain. Our group used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate functional brain connectivity in 12 complex regional pain syndrome patients in comparison with that in 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Data were analyzed using a seed voxel correlation analysis and an independent component analysis. An analysis of covariance was employed to relate alterations in functional connectivity with clinical symptoms. We found significantly greater reductions in functional default mode network connectivity in patients compared to controls. The functional connectivity maps of S1/M1 and IPS/MIP in patients revealed greater and more diffuse connectivity with other brain regions, mainly with the cingulate cortex, precuneus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex. In contrast, controls showed greater intraregional connectivity within S1/M1 and IPS/MIP. Furthermore, there was a trend for correlation between alterations in functional connectivity and intensity of neuropathic pain. In our findings, patients with complex regional pain syndrome have substantial spatial alterations in the functional connectivity between brain regions implicated in the resting-state default mode network, S1/M1, and IPS/MIP; these alterations show a trend of correlation with neuropathic pain intensity. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents spatial alterations in the functional resting-state connectivity of complex regional pain syndrome patients. Our results add further insight into the disease states of CRPS and into the functional architecture of the resting state brains of pain patients in general.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gulf War exposures in 1990 and 1991 have caused 25{\%} to 30{\%} of deployed personnel to develop a syndrome of chronic fatigue, pain, hyperalgesia, cognitive and affective dysfunction.

METHODS: Gulf War veterans (n = 31) and sedentary veteran and civilian controls (n = 20) completed fMRI scans for diffusion tensor imaging. A combination of dolorimetry, subjective reports of pain and fatigue were correlated to white matter diffusivity properties to identify tracts associated with symptom constructs.

RESULTS: Gulf War Illness subjects had significantly correlated fatigue, pain, hyperalgesia, and increased axial diffusivity in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. ROC generated thresholds and subsequent binary regression analysis predicted CMI classification based upon axial diffusivity in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These correlates were absent for controls in dichotomous regression analysis.

CONCLUSION: The right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus may be a potential biomarker for Gulf War Illness. This tract links cortical regions involved in fatigue, pain, emotional and reward processing, and the right ventral attention network in cognition. The axonal neuropathological mechanism(s) explaining increased axial diffusivity may account for the most prominent symptoms of Gulf War Illness.},

Compared with 18 healthy controls, MS patients showed gray matter volume reduction in the thalamus, hypothalamus, caudate, limbic lobe, and frontal lobe. A marked volume reduction of white matter was evident along the ventriculus lateralis and corpus callosum. FLAIR high-intensity lesions were observed beside the ventriculus lateralis. DTI revealed reduced fractional anisotropy areas similar to those of the FLAIR high-intensity lesions. Changes in the volume of increased mean diffusivity (MD) were the most widespread and extended to normal-appearing white matter (p{\textless}0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that MD values were significantly correlated with both disease duration (r=0.381, p=0.032) and expanded disability status scale scores (EDSS) (r=0.393, p=0.026). This study demonstrated that combined voxel-based analysis for volumetry, FLAIR high-intensity lesions, and DTI could reveal widespread brain abnormalities in MS patients. Furthermore, DTI, especially MD, showed far more widespread brain degeneration than other MRI parameters, and was significantly correlated with both severity and disease duration.},

This equation is solved to give the expression for the generalized Stejskal-Tanner formula quantifying diffusive attenuation in complicated geometries. This makes it possible to calculate the components of higher-rank tensors without using the computationally-difficult spherical harmonic transform. General theoretical relations between the diffusion tensor (DT) components measured by traditional (rank-2) DT imaging (DTI) and 3D distribution of diffusivities, as measured by high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) methods, are derived. Also, the spherical tensor components from HARDI are related to the rank-2 DT. The relationships between higher- and lower-rank Cartesian DTs are also presented. The inadequacy of the traditional rank-2 tensor model is demonstrated with simulations, and the method is applied to excised rat brain data collected in a spin-echo HARDI experiment},

Naturally farrowed SGA (0.7-1.0 kg BW) and average for gestational age (AGA, 1.3-1.6 kg BW) piglets were obtained on postnatal day (PD) 2, placed in individual cages, and provided a nutritionally adequate milk replacer diet (285 ml/kg/d). Beginning at PD14, performance in a spatial T-maze task was assessed. At PD28, piglets were anesthetized for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to assess brain structure (voxel-based morphometry), connectivity (diffusion-tensor imaging) and metabolites in the hippocampus and corpus callosum (proton MR spectroscopy). Piglets born SGA showed compensatory growth such that BW of SGA and AGA piglets was similar (P{\textgreater}0.05), by PD15. Birth weight affected maze performance, with SGA piglets taking longer to reach criterion than AGA piglets (p{\textless}0.01). Total brain volume of SGA and AGA piglets was similar (P{\textless}0.05), but overall, SGA piglets had less gray matter than AGA piglets (p{\textless}0.01) and tended to have a smaller internal capsule (p = 0.07). Group comparisons between SGA and AGA piglets defined 9 areas (≥ 20 clusters) where SGA piglets had less white matter (p{\textless}0.01); 2 areas where SGA piglets had more white matter (p{\textless}0.01); and 3 areas where SGA piglets had more gray matter (p{\textless}0.01). The impact of being born SGA on white matter was supported by a lower (p{\textless}0.04) fractional anisotropy value for SGA piglets, suggesting reduced white matter development and connectivity. None of the metabolites measured were different between groups. Collectively, the results show that SGA piglets have spatial learning deficits and abnormal development of white matter. As learning deficits and abnormalities in white matter are common in SGA human infants, the piglet is a tractable translational model that can be used to investigate SGA-associated cognitive deficits and potential interventions.},

We reviewed MRI scans of 275 MS patients for the presence of gadolinium enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted images, anatomical and signal abnormalities on different sequences at the pontine trigeminal root entry zone (REZ) and in the cisternal portion of the nerves. We observed enhancement in the cisternal portion of the nerves and signal abnormalities (with or without enhancement) at the pontine trigeminal REZ in 8 (2.9{\%}) patients, and enhancement was bilateral in 6 (75{\%}) of those. Despite the inflammatory activity, none of them had TN and 3 (37.5{\%}) had only painless paraesthesias in the correspondent V3 distribution. We also found a marked trigeminal hypertrophy in 2 (25{\%}) patients, both with a longer period of disease. Our results confirm a high and clinically silent incidence of trigeminal involvement in MS patients, and suggest a simultaneous role of the central and peripheral type of myelin in trigeminal demyelination},

abstract = {One method of evaluating the degree of neurologic impairment in MS has been the combination of grades (0 = normal to 5 or 6 = maximal impairment) within 8 Functional Systems (FS) and an overall Disability Status Scale (DSS) that had steps from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). A new Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is presented, with each of the former steps (1,2,3 . . . 9) now divided into two (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 . . . 9.5). The lower portion is obligatorily defined by Functional System grades. The FS are Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Brain Stem, Sensory, Bowel {\&} Bladder, Visual, Cerebral, and Other; the Sensory and Bowel {\&} Bladder Systems have been revised. Patterns of FS and relations of FS by type and grade to the DSS are demonstrated.},

abstract = {With the advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the study of plastic changes in white matter architecture due to long-term practice has attracted increasing interest. Professional musicians provide an ideal model for investigating white matter plasticity because of their early onset of extensive auditory and sensorimotor training. We performed fiber tractography and subsequent voxelwise analysis, region of interest (ROI) analysis, and detailed slicewise analysis of diffusion parameters in the corticospinal tract (CST) on 26 professional musicians and a control group of 13 participants. All analyses resulted in significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in both the left and the right CST in the musician group. Furthermore, a right-greater-than-left asymmetry of FA was observed regardless of group. In the musician group, diffusivity was negatively correlated with the onset of musical training in childhood. A subsequent median split into an early and a late onset musician group (median=7 years) revealed increased diffusivity in the CST of the early onset group as compared to both the late onset group and the controls. In conclusion, these DTI-based findings might indicate plastic changes in white matter architecture of the CST in professional musicians. Our results imply that training-induced changes in diffusion characteristics of the axonal membrane may lead to increased radial diffusivity as reflected in decreased FA values.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been great interest in oscillatory activity in the brain and in the role of pathological oscillations in the basal ganglia in mediating some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, thalamic and subthalamic nucleus local field potentials were intraoperatively recorded from pairs of closely separated microelectrodes in six PD patients ON and OFF dopaminergic medication. Using correlation and coherence analyses, we found high-frequency oscillatory activity in the 110-170 Hz band in thalamus in patients OFF dopamine. These oscillations were significantly reduced after administration of dopamine-replacement therapy. In contrast, activity in the lower frequencies (the theta and beta ranges) was increased. However, in subthalamic nucleus, we observed an increase in high-frequency oscillatory activity (150-200 Hz), and a reduction of the activity in the low-frequency range after levodopa administration. These findings confirm and extend earlier findings suggesting that in PD there are marked changes in basal ganglia oscillatory activity and that these can be reversed after dopaminergic therapy.},

abstract = {Detection and avoidance of impending obstacles is crucial to preventing head and body injuries in daily life. To safely avoid obstacles, locations of objects approaching the body surface are usually detected via the visual system and then used by the motor system to guide defensive movements. Mediating between visual input and motor output, the posterior parietal cortex plays an important role in integrating multisensory information in peripersonal space. We used functional MRI to map parietal areas that see and feel multisensory stimuli near or on the face and body. Tactile experiments using full-body air-puff stimulation suits revealed somatotopic areas of the face and multiple body parts forming a higher-level homunculus in the superior posterior parietal cortex. Visual experiments using wide-field looming stimuli revealed retinotopic maps that overlap with the parietal face and body areas in the postcentral sulcus at the most anterior border of the dorsal visual pathway. Starting at the parietal face area and moving medially and posteriorly into the lower-body areas, the median of visual polar-angle representations in these somatotopic areas gradually shifts from near the horizontal meridian into the lower visual field. These results suggest the parietal face and body areas fuse multisensory information in peripersonal space to guard an individual from head to toe.},

abstract = {The affective dimension of pain is made up of feelings of unpleasantness and emotions associated with future implications, termed secondary affect. Experimental and clinical studies show serial interactions between pain sensation intensity, pain unpleasantness, and secondary affect. These pain dimensions and their interactions relate to a central network of brain structures that processes nociceptive information both in parallel and in series. Spinal pathways to limbic structures and medial thalamic nuclei provide direct inputs to brain areas involved in affect. Another source is from spinal pathways to somatosensory thalamic and cortical areas and then through a cortico-limbic pathway. The latter integrates nociceptive input with contextual information and memory to provide cognitive mediation of pain affect. Both direct and cortico-limbic pathways converge on the same anterior cingulate cortical and subcortical structures whose function may be to establish emotional valence and response priorities},

abstract = {We introduce an automatic method that we call tract-based morphometry, or TBM, for measurement and analysis of diffusion MRI data along white matter fiber tracts. Using subject-specific tractography bundle segmentations, we generate an arc length parameterization of the bundle with point correspondences across all fibers and all subjects, allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this paper we present a quantitative comparison of fiber coordinate systems from the literature and we introduce an improved optimal match method that reduces spatial distortion and improves intra- and inter-subject variability of FA measurements. We propose a method for generating arc length correspondences across hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of interhemispheric diffusion asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and cingulum bundle (CB). The results of this study demonstrate that TBM can detect differences that may not be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD) differences found in AF. We report TBM results of higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower lambda(3), the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left AF), and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related to higher lambda(1), the largest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left CB). By mapping the significance levels onto the tractography trajectories for each structure, we demonstrate the anatomical locations of the interhemispheric differences. The TBM approach brings analysis of DTI data into the clinically and neuroanatomically relevant framework of the tract anatomy.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Using a large US health insurance claims database, we identified all persons aged 18 years or older with 2 or more medical encounters in calendar year 2000 for painful neuropathic disorders (PNDs). We also identified an age- and gender-matched group of patients without PNDs (matched control subjects). We then compared the clinical characteristics and economic costs of PND patients with those of matched control subjects. There were a total of 55,686 patients with PNDs in the study database. The most frequently noted PNDs were back and neck pain with neuropathic involvement (62.3{\%} of PND patients), causalgia (12.1{\%}), and diabetic neuropathy (10.8{\%}). In comparison with matched control subjects, PND patients were more likely to have other pain-related conditions, including fibromyalgia (6.0{\%} vs 0.6{\%} for control subjects), osteoarthritis (13.6{\%} vs 3.6{\%}), and other chronic comorbidities, such as coronary heart disease (13.6{\%} vs 6.5{\%}) and depression (6.4{\%} vs 2.3{\%}). Total calendar year 2000 health care charges were 3-fold higher for PND patients than matched control subjects ({\$}17,355 vs {\$}5,715, respectively). Our results suggest that patients with PNDs are generally in poorer health and have higher health care costs than their peers without these conditions. PERSPECTIVE Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids was widespread in patients with PNDs, while relatively few received antiepileptic drugs and tricyclic antidepressants, both of which are often more effective against neuropathic pain. Our study raises questions about the optimality of PND treatment in clinical practice.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach for joint clustering and point-by-point mapping of white matter fiber pathways. Knowledge of the point correspondence along the fiber pathways is not only necessary for accurate clustering of the trajectories into fiber bundles, but also crucial for any tract-oriented quantitative analysis. We employ an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to cluster the trajectories in a gamma mixture model context. The result of clustering is the probabilistic assignment of the fiber trajectories to each cluster, an estimate of the cluster parameters, i.e. spatial mean and variance, and point correspondences. The fiber bundles are modeled by the mean trajectory and its spatial variation. Point-by-point correspondence of the trajectories within a bundle is obtained by constructing a distance map and a label map from each cluster center at every iteration of the EM algorithm. This offers a time-efficient alternative to pairwise curve matching of all trajectories with respect to each cluster center. The proposed method has the potential to benefit from an anatomical atlas of fiber tracts by incorporating it as prior information in the EM algorithm. The algorithm is also capable of handling outliers in a principled way. The presented results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework for quantitative analysis of diffusion tensor MRI. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a key node in the brain's ventral attention network (VAN) that is involved in spatial awareness and detection of salient sensory stimuli, including pain. The anatomical basis of this network's right-lateralized organization is poorly understood. Here we used diffusion-weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography to compare the strength of white matter connections emanating from the right versus left TPJ to target regions in both hemispheres. Symmetry of structural connectivity was evaluated for connections between TPJ and target regions that are key cortical nodes in the right VAN (insula and inferior frontal gyrus) as well as target regions that are involved in salience and/or pain (putamen, cingulate cortex, thalamus). We found a rightward asymmetry in connectivity strength between the TPJ and insula in healthy human subjects who were scanned with two different sets of diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition parameters. This rightward asymmetry in TPJ-insula connectivity was stronger in females than in males. There was also a leftward asymmetry in connectivity strength between the TPJ and inferior frontal gyrus, consistent with previously described lateralization of language pathways. The rightward lateralization of the pathway between the TPJ and insula supports previous findings on the roles of these regions in stimulus-driven attention, sensory awareness, interoception and pain. The findings also have implications for our understanding of acute and chronic pains and stroke-induced spatial hemineglect.},

abstract = {The main impact of functional neuroimaging has been its ability to locate neuronal activity either directly (EEG, MEG) or through the hemodynamic response caused by neuronal activity (PET, fMRI). In the past decade functional neuroimaging has been extended to investigate how brain regions interact, using the concepts of functional and effective connectivity. These concepts are further strengthened by estimates of anatomical connectivity of the same subject. A tool to determine anatomical connectivity in vivo may be provided by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods. These can be used to determine the orientation of fiber bundles in white matter on the basis of the diffusion characteristics of water. Commonly, DTI data are acquired using echo planar imaging which suffers from susceptibility artifacts in orbitofrontal and inferior temporal cortex. Here we demonstrate the use of an alternative pulse sequence, diffusion-weighted single-shot STEAM, for assessing fiber orientation in orbitofrontal cortex and the cranial nerves. The scope of DTI needs to be extended to these structures to investigate psychiatric disorders in which orbitofrontal pathology or temporo-frontal disconnection have been postulated},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The understanding of the mechanisms underlying chronic pain is of major scientific and clinical interest. This review focuses on neuroimaging studies of pain-induced neuroplastic changes in the human brain and discusses five major categories of pain-induced neuroplastic changes.

RECENT FINDINGS: First, peripheral or central sensitization may result in increased nociceptive input to the brain and also changes the processing of nociceptive information within the brain. Second, chronic nociceptive input from the periphery or from lesions within the central nervous system may result in cortical reorganization and maladaptive neuroplasticity within somatosensory and motor systems. Thirdly, there is evidence for pain-induced changes in large-scale neuronal network connectivity. Fourth, in patients with chronic pain, structural brain changes may occur. Finally, there is discussion that in chronic pain patients the endogenous pain-modulatory system may function aberrantly.

SUMMARY: Recent work has substantially broadened our insights into neuroplastic changes that are involved in pain chronification. Future research will focus on the question of whether neuroimaging techniques can be used in the individual chronic pain patient as a biomarker that would allow for an objective diagnosis of different pain conditions and for the prediction of individual responses to specific therapies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The collateral circulation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Current knowledge of the collateral circulation remains sparse, largely because of prior limitations in methods for evaluation of these diminutive routes of cerebral blood flow.

SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Anatomic descriptions of the collateral circulation often focus on more proximal anastomoses at the circle of Willis, neglecting secondary collateral pathways provided by leptomeningeal vessels. Pathophysiological recruitment of collateral vessels likely depends on the temporal course of numerous compensatory hemodynamic, metabolic, and neural mechanisms. Subsequent endurance of these protective vascular pathways may determine the severity of ischemic injury. Characterization of the collateral circulation with advanced neuroimaging modalities that provide angiographic information and perfusion data may elucidate critical determinants of collateral blood flow. Such information on the status of the collateral circulation may be used to guide therapeutic interventions. Prognostication and risk stratification may also be improved by routine evaluation of collateral blood flow.

CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary understanding of the collateral circulation may be greatly enhanced through further refinement of neuroimaging modalities that correlate angiographic findings with perfusion status, providing the basis for future therapeutic and prognostic applications.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography was used to investigate microstructural and volumetric abnormalities of the major brain white matter (WM) tracts with aging in 84 healthy subjects. Linear relationships were found between age and mean diffusivity (MD) increase and fractional anisotropy (FA) decrease in all WM tracts, except the right cingulum and bilateral uncinate, where a linear correlation with age was found for FA only. Quadratic model fitted better MD and FA values of several tracts, including the corpus callosum, limbic pathways, and bilateral association, and corticospinal tracts. Age-related MD and FA abnormalities were associated with radial diffusivity increase in all WM tracts, while axial diffusivity changes were characterized by a considerable variation from a tract to another. A linear negative relationship with age was found for the volumes of the left cingulum and fornix, while the quadratic model fitted better age-related volume loss of corpus callosum and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging may shed light into the complex pathological substrates of WM changes with aging.},

abstract = {Cortical development is associated with a series of events that involve axon and dendrite growth and synaptic formation. Although these developmental processes have been investigated in detail with histology, three-dimensional and quantitative imaging methods for rodent brains may be useful for genetic and pharmacological studies in which cortical developmental abnormalities are suspected. It has been shown that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can delineate the columnar organization of the fetal and early neonatal cortex based on a high degree of diffusion anisotropy along the columnar structures. This anisotropy is known to decrease during brain development. In this study, we applied DTI to developing rat brains at five developmental stages, postnatal days 0, 3, 7, 11 and 19, and used diffusion anisotropy as an index to characterize the structural change. Statistical analysis reveals four distinctive cortical areas that demonstrate a characteristic time course of anisotropy loss. This method may provide a means to delineate specific cortical areas and a quantitative method to detect abnormalities in cortical development in rodent pathological models},

abstract = {While it is well established that individuals with psychopathy have a marked deficit in affective arousal, emotional empathy, and caring for the well-being of others, the extent to which perspective taking can elicit an emotional response has not yet been studied despite its potential application in rehabilitation. In healthy individuals, affective perspective taking has proven to be an effective means to elicit empathy and concern for others. To examine neural responses in individuals who vary in psychopathy during affective perspective taking, 121 incarcerated males, classified as high (n = 37; Hare psychopathy checklist-revised, PCL-R ≥ 30), intermediate (n = 44; PCL-R between 21 and 29), and low (n = 40; PCL-R ≤ 20) psychopaths, were scanned while viewing stimuli depicting bodily injuries and adopting an imagine-self and an imagine-other perspective. During the imagine-self perspective, participants with high psychopathy showed a typical response within the network involved in empathy for pain, including the anterior insula (aINS), anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), somatosensory cortex, and right amygdala. Conversely, during the imagine-other perspective, psychopaths exhibited an atypical pattern of brain activation and effective connectivity seeded in the anterior insula and amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The response in the amygdala and insula was inversely correlated with PCL-R Factor 1 (interpersonal/affective) during the imagine-other perspective. In high psychopaths, scores on PCL-R Factor 1 predicted the neural response in ventral striatum when imagining others in pain. These patterns of brain activation and effective connectivity associated with differential perspective-taking provide a better understanding of empathy dysfunction in psychopathy, and have the potential to inform intervention programs for this complex clinical problem.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective.

abstract = {OBJECT: Although microvascular decompression (MVD) for patients with medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is widely accepted as the treatment of choice, other "second-tier" treatments are frequently offered to elderly patients due to concerns regarding fitness for surgery. The authors sought to determine the safety and effectiveness of MVD for TN in patients older than 75 years of age. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of medical records and conducted follow-up telephone interviews with the patients. The outcome data from 25 MVD operations for TN performed in 25 patients with a mean age of 79.4 years (range 75-88 years) were compared with those of a control group of 25 younger patients with a mean age of 42.3 years (range 17-50 years) who underwent MVDs during the same 30-month period from July 2000 to December 2003. RESULTS: Initial pain relief was achieved in 96{\%} of the patients in both groups (p = 1.0). There were no operative deaths in either group. After an average follow-up period of 44 and 52 months, 78 and 72{\%} of patients in the elderly and control groups, respectively, remained pain free without medication (p = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular decompression is an effective treatment for elderly patients with TN. The authors' experience suggests that the rate of complications and death after MVD for TN in elderly patients is no different from the rate in younger patients},

abstract = {The fornix is a discrete white matter tract bundle that is critical for normal cognitive functioning. Although clearly visualized at magnetic resonance imaging, its involvement in pathologic processes is often overlooked. Certain disease processes show a predilection for involvement of the fornix; in other pathologic conditions, its involvement is a rare but recognized finding. As part of the Papez circuit, it is critical in formation of memory, with damage or disease resulting in anterograde amnesia. Many different pathologic conditions can affect the fornix. Midline tumors such as gliomas or lymphoma can infiltrate it. As part of the limbic system, it may be affected by herpes simplex encephalitis. Involvement by inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis may illustrate its importance in global cognitive function. An appreciation of forniceal atrophy may aid in assessment of mesial temporal sclerosis. Metabolic conditions such as Wernicke encephalopathy have been reported to involve it. The original discoveries of its role in memory arose from surgical trauma, but as a midline structure, it is susceptible to the shearing forces of diffuse axonal injury. Infarction of the fornix is rare but can result in acute amnesic syndromes. Its role in degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease and psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia is a topic of research interest. Recognition of involvement of the fornix by various pathologic processes may aid in explaining the troubling clinical symptoms of amnesia.},

@article{Bingel2008a,
abstract = {Pain is a highly complex and subjective experience that is not linearly related to the nociceptive input. What is clear from anecdotal reports over the centuries and more recently from animal and human experimentation is that nociceptive information processing and consequent pain perception is subject to significant pro- and anti-nociceptive modulations. These modulations can be initiated reflexively or by contextual manipulations of the pain experience including cognitive and emotional factors. This provides a necessary survival function since it allows the pain experience to be altered according to the situation rather than having pain always dominate. The so-called descending pain modulatory network involving predominantly medial and frontal cortical areas, in combination with specific subcortical and brain stem nuclei appears to be one key system for the endogenous modulation of pain. Furthermore, recent findings from functional and anatomical neuroimaging support the notion that an altered interaction of pro- and anti-nociceptive mechanisms may contribute to the development or maintenance of chronic pain states. Research on the involved circuitry and implemented mechanisms is a major focus of contemporary neuroscientific research in the field of pain and should provide new insights to prevent and treat chronic pain states},

abstract = {Chronic pain patients suffer from more than just pain; depression and anxiety, sleep disturbances, and decision-making abnormalities (Apkarian et al., 2004a) also significantly diminish their quality of life. Recent studies have demonstrated that chronic pain harms cortical areas unrelated to pain (Apkarian et al., 2004b; Acerra and Moseley, 2005), but whether these structural impairments and behavioral deficits are connected by a single mechanism is as of yet unknown. Here we propose that long-term pain alters the functional connectivity of cortical regions known to be active at rest, i.e., the components of the "default mode network" (DMN). This DMN (Raichle et al., 2001; Greicius et al., 2003; Vincent et al., 2007) is marked by balanced positive and negative correlations between activity in component brain regions. In several disorders, however this balance is disrupted (Fox and Raichle, 2007). Using well validated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms to study the DMN (Fox et al., 2005), we investigated whether the impairments of chronic pain patients could be rooted in disturbed DMN dynamics. Studying with fMRI a group of chronic back pain (CBP) patients and healthy controls while executing a simple visual attention task, we discovered that CBP patients, despite performing the task equally well as controls, displayed reduced deactivation in several key DMN regions. These findings demonstrate that chronic pain has a widespread impact on overall brain function, and suggest that disruptions of the DMN may underlie the cognitive and behavioral impairments accompanying chronic pain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate an ocular motor role for the STN in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. METHODS: Potentials were recorded from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted in the vicinity of STN in five PD patients, while patients simultaneously performed visually cued saccades, self-paced saccades and in two patients self-paced wrist extensions. RESULTS: Premovement potentials related to visually cued saccades were found in 4/5 patients and 56{\%} (5/9) of potentials showed phase reversal indicating a local generator. Onsets of these potentials began closer to saccade initiation from STN contacts (0.88+/-0.30s) than thalamic ones (1.39+/-0.28 s). Self-paced saccade-related potentials were found in 4/4 patients. Self-paced saccade potential onsets (1.82+/-0.88 s) were not different from self-paced wrist extension onsets (1.27+/-0.98 s), suggesting a non-specific mechanism could be responsible for both potentials. 50{\%} (3/6) of potentials to self-paced saccades and 66{\%} (2/3) of potentials to self-paced wrist extensions showed phase reversal. Potentials could be found either ipsilaterally or contralaterally with respect to saccade direction. CONCLUSIONS: These subcortical premovement potentials to saccades are similar to Bereitschaftspotentials and contingent negative variations to limb movements recorded in cortical and subcortical regions. SIGNIFICANCE: These studies further support a role of STN in ocular motor control and suggest a common mechanism of motor preparation for both eye and limb movements in the basal ganglia.},

abstract = {Video recordings of free behavior and responses to mechanical facial stimulation were analyzed to assess whether chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the rat's infraorbital nerve (IoN) results in behavioral alterations indicative of neuropathic pain. A unilateral CCI was produced by placing loose chromic gut ligatures around the IoN. After CCI to the IoN, rats exhibited changes in both non-evoked and evoked behavior. Behavioral changes developed in two phases. Early after CCI (postoperative days 1-15), rats showed increased face-grooming activity with face-wash strokes directed to the injured nerve territory, while the responsiveness to stimulation of this area was decreased. Later after CCI (postoperative days 15-130), the prevalence of asymmetric face grooming was reduced but remained significantly increased compared to control rats. The early hyporesponsiveness was abruptly replaced by an extreme hyperresponsiveness: all stimulus intensities applied to the injured nerve territory evoked the "maximal" response (brisk head withdrawal, avoidance behavior plus directed face grooming). This response was never observed in control rats. Concurrently, IoN ligation rats showed a limited increase in the responsiveness to stimulation of the contralateral IoN territory, and around postoperative days 30-40 the responsiveness to stimulation of facial areas outside the IoN territories also increased. The hyperresponsiveness to stimulation of the ligated IoN territory slightly decreased from 60 d postoperative. Throughout the study, IoN ligation rats showed decreased exploratory behavior, displayed more freezing-like behavior, had a slower body weight gain, and a higher defecation rate, compared to control rats. The behavioral alterations observed after CCI to the IoN are indicative of severe sensory disturbances within the territory of the injured nerve: mechanical allodynia develops after a period of relative hypo-/anesthesia during which behavioral signs of recurrent spontaneous, aversive (possibly painful) sensations (paresthesias/dysesthesias) are maximal.},

abstract = {It is well established that healthy aging is accompanied by structural changes in many brain regions and functional decline in a number of cognitive domains. The goal of this study was to determine (1) whether the regional distribution of age-related brain changes is similar in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) regions, or whether these two tissue types are affected differently by aging, and (2) whether measures of cognitive performance are more closely linked to alterations in the cerebral cortex or in the underlying WM in older adults (OA). To address these questions, we collected high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a large sample of healthy young adults (YA; aged 18-28) and OA (aged 61-86 years). In addition, the OA completed a series of tasks selected to assess cognition in three domains: cognitive control, episodic memory, and semantic memory. Using advanced techniques for measuring cortical thickness and WM integrity, we found that healthy aging was accompanied by deterioration of both GM and WM, but with distinct patterns of change: Cortical thinning occurred primarily in primary sensory and motor cortices, whereas WM changes were localized to regions underlying association cortices. Further, in OA, we found a striking pattern of region-specific correlations between measures of cognitive performance and WM integrity, but not cortical thickness. Specifically, cognitive control correlated with integrity of frontal lobe WM, whereas episodic memory was related to integrity of temporal and parietal lobe WM. Thus, age-related impairments in specific cognitive capacities may arise from degenerative processes that affect the underlying connections of their respective neural networks.},

abstract = {Patients in the completely locked-in state have no means of communication and they represent the target population for brain-computer interface research in the last 15 years. Although different paradigms have been tested and different physiological signals used, to date no sufficiently documented completely locked-in state patient was able to control a brain-computer interface over an extended time period. We introduce Pavlovian semantic conditioning to enable basic communication in completely locked-in state. This novel paradigm is based on semantic conditioning for online classification of neuroelectric or any other physiological signals to discriminate between covert (cognitive) 'yes' and 'no' responses. The paradigm comprised the presentation of affirmative and negative statements used as conditioned stimuli, while the unconditioned stimulus consisted of electrical stimulation of the skin paired with affirmative statements. Three patients with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis participated over an extended time period, one of which was in a completely locked-in state, the other two in the locked-in state. The patients' level of vigilance was assessed through auditory oddball procedures to study the correlation between vigilance level and the classifier's performance. The average online classification accuracies of slow cortical components of electroencephalographic signals were around chance level for all the patients. The use of a non-linear classifier in the offline classification procedure resulted in a substantial improvement of the accuracy in one locked-in state patient achieving 70{\%} correct classification. A reliable level of performance in the completely locked-in state patient was not achieved uniformly throughout the 37 sessions despite intact cognitive processing capacity, but in some sessions communication accuracies up to 70{\%} were achieved. Paradigm modifications are proposed. Rapid drop of vigilance was detected suggesting attentional variations or variations of circadian period as important factors in brain-computer interface communication with locked-in state and completely locked-in state.},

Single-cell recordings in parietal cortex have identified multisensory neurons with spatially restricted, aligned visual and somatosensory receptive fields, but so far, there has been no evidence for a topographic map in this area. Here we mapped the organization of a multisensory parietal face area in humans by acquiring functional magnetic resonance images while varying the polar angle of facial air puffs and close-up visual stimuli. We found aligned maps of tactile and near-face visual stimuli at the highest level of human association cortex-namely, in the superior part of the postcentral sulcus. We show that this area may code the location of visual stimuli with respect to the face, not with respect to the retina.},

Accumulating functional, anatomical and imaging findings indicate that pain is generated by specific sensory channels that ascend in a central homeostatic afferent pathway. Phylogenetically new thalamocortical projections in primates provide a sensory image of the physiological condition of the body and, in addition, direct activation of limbic motor cortex. These findings indicate that the human feeling of pain is both a distinct sensation and a motivation - that is, a specific emotion that reflects homeostatic behavioral drive, similar to temperature, itch, hunger and thirst.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A significant number of patients with epilepsy remain poorly controlled despite antiepileptic medication (AED) treatment and are not eligible for resective surgery. Novel therapeutic methods are required to decrease seizure burden in this population. Several observations have indicated that the anterior thalamic region plays an important role in the maintenance and propagation of seizures. We investigated neuromodulation of the anterior thalamus by using deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with intractable seizures. METHODS: Five patients with medically refractory epilepsy underwent stereotactic placement of and received stimulation through bilateral DBS electrodes in the anterior thalamus. RESULTS: Treatment showed a statistically significant decrease in seizure frequency, with a mean reduction of 54{\%} (mean follow-up, 15 months). Two of the patients had a seizure reduction of {\textgreater} or =75{\%}. No adverse effects were observed after DBS electrode insertion or stimulation. Unexpectedly, the observed benefits did not differ between stimulation-on and stimulation-off periods. CONCLUSIONS: DBS of the anterior thalamus is a safe procedure and possibly effective in patients with medically resistant seizures.},

abstract = {Animal and human studies have consistently demonstrated that cortical regions are important for pain perception and pain-related emotional changes. Studies of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have shown that adult cortical synapses can be modified after peripheral injuries, and long-term changes at synaptic level may contribute to long-lasting suffering in patients. It also explains why chronic pain is resistant to conventional analgesics that act by inhibiting synaptic transmission. Insular cortex (IC), another critical cortical area, is found to be highly plastic and can undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) after injury. Inhibiting IC LTP reduces behavioral sensitization caused by injury. LTP of glutamatergic transmission in pain related cortical areas serves as a key mechanism for chronic pain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional neural networks in the human brain can be studied from correlations between activated gray matter regions measured with fMRI. However, while providing important information on gray matter activation, no information is gathered on the co-activity along white matter tracts in neural networks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report on a functional diffusion tensor imaging (fDTI) method that measures task-related changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) along white matter tracts. We hypothesize that these fractional anisotropy changes relate to morphological changes of glial cells induced by axonal activity although the exact physiological underpinnings of the measured FA changes remain to be elucidated. As expected, these changes are very small as compared to the physiological noise and a reliable detection of the signal change would require a large number of measurements. However, a substantial increase in signal-to-noise ratio was achieved by pooling the signal over the complete fiber tract. Adopting such a tract-based statistics enabled us to measure the signal within a practically feasible time period. Activation in the sensory thalamocortical tract and optic radiation in eight healthy human subjects was found during tactile and visual stimulation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of our experiments indicate that these FA changes may serve as a functional contrast mechanism for white matter. This noninvasive fDTI method may provide a new approach to study functional neural networks in the human brain.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We present a new technique for registering magnetic resonance (MR) and ultrasound images in the context of neurosurgery. It involves generating a pseudo-ultrasound (pseudo-US) from a segmented MR image and uses cross-correlation as the cost function to register the pseudo-US to the real ultrasound data. The algorithm's performance is compared with that of a state-of-the-art technique that uses a median-filtered MR image to register to a Gaussian-blurred ultrasound using a normalized mutual information (NMI) objective function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The two methods were tested on data from 15 patients with brain tumor, including low-and high-grade gliomas, in both first operations and reoperations. Two metrics were used to evaluate registration accuracy: (1) the mean distance between corresponding points, identified on both MR and ultrasound images by two experts, and (2) ratings based on visual comparison by one neurosurgeon.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean residual distance of the pseudo-US technique, 2.97 mm, is significantly more accurate (p = .0011) than that of the NMI approach, 4.86 mm. The visual assessment shows that only 4 of the 15 cases had a satisfactory initial alignment based on homologous skin-point registration. There is a significant correlation between the quantitative distance measures and the qualitative ratings (rho = 0.785).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results show that the pseudo-US rigid registration technique robustly improves the MRI-ultrasound alignment when compared with the initial alignment, even when applied to highly distorted brains and a large range of tumor sizes and appearances.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative to conventional surgery for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The authors conducted a prospective evaluation of the safety and efficacy of this method in a large series of patients. METHODS: A total of 100 patients presenting with trigeminal neuralgia were treated and followed up for a minimum of 12 months. The mean age was 68.2 years; 54 patients were male, and 46 were female. Seven had a history of multiple sclerosis, and 42 had already received conventional surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. The intervention consisted of gamma knife surgery to the retrogasserian cisternal portion of the fifth cranial nerve. The median dose used at the maximum was 85 Gy (range 70-90 Gy). The number and intensity of pain attacks were recorded by the patient from 3 months before radiosurgery to a minimum of 12 months after treatment. Before and a minimum of 12 months after treatment, the patient completed a quality-of-life questionnaire. Neurological examination and quantitative sensory testing to evaluate sensory perception were performed by an independent neurologist over this same time period. At the last visit 83 of 100 patients were reported to be pain free. Fifty-eight of these 83 patients had stopped taking medication during the study. All quality-of-life parameters were improved (p {\textless} 0.001). Six patients reported facial paresthesia, and four patients reported hypesthesia. These symptoms were classified as mild. None of the complications reported for other techniques were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective alternative treatment for trigeminal neuralgia and is associated with a particularly low rate of hypesthesia},

abstract = {Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence generation or transformation problem. Recent work has shown that self-attention is an effective way of modeling textual sequences. In this work, we generalize a recently proposed model architecture based on self-attention, the Transformer, to a sequence modeling formulation of image generation with a tractable likelihood. By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods we significantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despite maintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutional neural networks. We propose another extension of self-attention allowing it to efficiently take advantage of the two-dimensional nature of images. While conceptually simple, our generative models significantly outperform the current state of the art in image generation on ImageNet, improving the best published negative log-likelihood on ImageNet from 3.83 to 3.77. We also present results on image super-resolution with a large magnification ratio, applying an encoder-decoder configuration of our architecture. In a human evaluation study, we show that our super-resolution models improve significantly over previously published super-resolution models. Images generated by the model fool human observers three times more often than the previous state of the art.},

abstract = {Destruction of articular cartilage is a characteristic feature of osteoarthritis (OA). Collagen hydrolysates are mixtures of collagen peptides and have gained huge public attention as nutriceuticals used for prophylaxis of OA. Here, we evaluated for the first time whether different bovine collagen hydrolysate preparations indeed modulate the metabolism of collagen and proteoglycans from human OA cartilage explants and determined the chemical composition of oligopeptides representing collagen fragments. Using biophysical techniques, like MALDI-TOF-MS, AFM, and NMR, the molecular weight distribution and aggregation behavior of collagen hydrolysates from bovine origin (CH-Alpha{\textregistered}, Peptan™ B 5000, Peptan™ B 2000) were determined. To investigate the metabolism of human femoral OA cartilage, explants were obtained during knee replacement surgery. Collagen synthesis of explants as modulated by 0-10 mg/ml collagen hydrolysates was determined using a novel dual radiolabeling procedure. Proteoglycans, NO, PGE(2), MMP-1, -3, -13, TIMP-1, collagen type II, and cell viability were determined in explant cultures. Groups of data were analyzed using ANOVA and the Friedman test (n = 5-12). The significance was set to p≤0.05. We found that collagen hydrolysates obtained from different sources varied with respect to the width of molecular weight distribution, average molecular weight, and aggregation behavior. None of the collagen hydrolysates tested stimulated the biosynthesis of collagen. Peptan™ B 5000 elevated NO and PGE(2) levels significantly but had no effect on collagen or proteoglycan loss. All collagen hydrolysates tested proved not to be cytotoxic. Together, our data demonstrate for the first time that various collagen hydrolysates differ with respect to their chemical composition of collagen fragments as well as by their pharmacological efficacy on human chondrocytes. Our study underscores the importance that each collagen hydrolysate preparation should first demonstrate its pharmacological potential both in vitro and in vivo before being used for both regenerative medicine and prophylaxis of OA.},

To study the action of glycerol, ten cats underwent unilateral retrogasserian injection of anhydrous glycerol. The contralateral (control) side was injected with saline. Glycerol injection increased the average latencies and reduced the average amplitudes of trigeminal brain-stem evoked potentials. Histopathologic examination disclosed focal demyelination, axonal swelling, endoneurial fibrosis, and neuronal loss. Evoked potentials were severely altered or abolished in cats with axonal damage in the maxillary portion of the postganglionic nerve.

abstract = {Reorganization of somatosensory cortex after peripheral nerve damage typically has been attributed to cortical plasticity. Here we provide evidence that much of the large-scale cortical reorganization that occurs after a major loss of peripheral inputs reflects the sprouting or expansion of afferents from the remaining forelimb into deprived territories of the spinal cord and brainstem. We examined sensory afferent terminations in the spinal cord and brainstem, and determined the somatotopic organization of cortical area 3b in three adult monkeys with previous hand or forearm amputation, as veterinary treatment of forelimb injuries. In each monkey, the distribution of labeled sensory afferent terminations from the remaining parts of the fore-limb was much more extensive than the normal distribution of inputs from the forelimb, and extended into portions of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the cuneate nucleus of the brainstem related to the amputated hand. In the same animals, tactile stimulation of the forelimb activated much of the deprived hand representation in area 3b of cortex; the lateral portion of the deprived region in area 3B appeared to be reactivated by inputs from the face. These data provide important new evidence that one of the mechanisms subserving large scale reorganization in cortex is a relay of topographic changes that occur subcortically. Presumably, the expanded primary sensory inputs activate postsynaptic neurons that are normally driven by inputs from the hand so that the neurons now have receptive fields on the forearm. Since the topographic representation of the body is greatly magnified in the relay to cortex, the subcortical changes can result in dramatic cortical map changes.},

abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fornix is the predominant outflow tract of the hippocampus, a brain region known to be affected early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aims of the present study were to: (1) examine the cross-sectional relationship between fornix diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity), hippocampal volume, and memory performance, and (2) compare fornix DTI measures with hippocampal volumes as predictors of progression and transition from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia. METHODS: Twenty-three mild cognitive impairment participants for whom hippocampal volumetry and DTI were conducted at baseline received detailed evaluations at baseline; 3, 6, and 12 months; and 2.5 years. Six participants converted to AD over the follow-up period. Fornix and posterior cingulum DTI measurements and hippocampal volumes were ascertained using manual measures. Random effects models assessed each of the neuroimaging measures as predictors of decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes, and memory z scores; receiver operating characteristic analyses examined the predictive value for conversion to AD. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between fornix FA and hippocampal volumes. However, only the fornix measurements (FA, MD, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity) were cross-sectionally correlated with memory z scores. Both fornix FA and hippocampal volumes were predictive of memory decline. Individually, fornix FA and MD and hippocampal volumes were very good predictors of progression, with likelihood ratios {\textgreater}83, and better than 90{\%} accuracy. CONCLUSION: Fornix FA both cross-sectionally correlated with and longitudinally predicted memory decline and progression to AD. Manually drawn region of interest within the fornix shows promise comparable with hippocampal volume as a predictive biomarker of progression, and this finding warrants replication in a larger study.},

abstract = {We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction. The model leverages the structure information to form better semantic representations and better language modeling. Standard recurrent neural networks are limited by their structure and fail to efficiently use syntactic information. On the other hand, tree-structured recursive networks usually require additional structural supervision at the cost of human expert annotation. In this paper, We propose a novel neural language model, called the Parsing-Reading-Predict Networks (PRPN), that can simultaneously induce the syntactic structure from unannotated sentences and leverage the inferred structure to learn a better language model. In our model, the gradient can be directly back-propagated from the language model loss into the neural parsing network. Experiments show that the proposed model can discover the underlying syntactic structure and achieve state-of-the-art performance on word/character-level language model tasks.},

abstract = {Microvascular decompression is preferred among open procedures for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. However, in some cases the decompression cannot be performed, either because no significant vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve is found at surgery or because a patient's vascular anatomy makes it unsafe. Partial sensory rhizotomy is a commonly used alternative in these instances. The outcome after partial sensory rhizotomy was reviewed retrospectively in 83 patients with an average follow-up period of 72 months. Sixty-four (77{\%}) of these patients had no evidence of vascular contact at operation. The remaining 19 patients (23{\%}) had vascular structures in proximity to the trigeminal nerve but still underwent partial sensory rhizotomy in place of or in addition to microvascular decompression either because the offending vessel could not be moved adequately (11 cases) or because the vascular contact was considered insignificant (eight cases). Outcome was classified as: excellent if there was no trigeminal neuralgia postoperatively; good if pain persisted or recurred but was less severe than preoperatively; and poor if persistent or recurrent pain was equal to or greater than the preoperative pain in severity and was refractory to medication, or was severe enough to require additional surgery. The outcome was excellent in 40 patients (48{\%}), good in 18 (22{\%}), and poor in 25 (30{\%}); follow-up durations were similar for the three outcome categories. The failure rate was 17{\%} for the 1st year and averaged 2.6{\%} each year thereafter. Two variables were predictive of a poor outcome: prior surgery and lack of preoperative involvement of the third trigeminal division. Major complications occurred in 4{\%} of cases and minor complications in 11{\%}. The authors conclude that partial sensory rhizotomy is a safe and effective alternative to microvascular decompression when neurovascular compression is not identified at operation or when microvascular decompression cannot be performed for technical reasons.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of the origin of consciousness is built upon the unique properties of the mammalian neocortex. The apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells bundle together as they ascend to lamina I to form neural receptor units of approximately 100 apical dendrites plus branches receiving hundreds of thousands of excitatory synapses, the collective assemblage being called a dendron. It is proposed that the whole world of consciousness, the mental world, is microgranular, with mental units called psychons, and that in mind-brain interaction one psychon is linked to one dendron through quantum physics. The hypothesis is that in mammalian evolution dendrons evolved for more effective integration of the increased complexity of sensory inputs. These evolved dendrons had the capacity for interacting with psychons that came to exist, so forming the mental world and giving the mammal conscious experiences. In Darwinian evolution, consciousness would have occurred initially some 200 million years ago in relation to the primitive cerebral cortices of evolving mammals. It would give global experiences of a surrounding world for guiding behavior beyond what is given by the unconscious operation of sensory cortical areas per se. So conscious experiences would give mammals evolutionary advantage over the reptiles, which lack a neocortex giving consciousness. The Wulst of the avian brain needs further investigation to discover how it could give birds the consciousness that they seem to have.},

abstract = {After ischemic brain injury various cell types including neurons, glia and endothelial cells are damaged and lose their function. Effective regeneration of brain tissue requires that all these cell types have to be replenished and combined to form a new functional network. Recent advances in regenerative medicine show the ability of stem cells to differentiate into various cell lineages. Several types of stem cells have been used to treat ischemic brain injury in rodent models including neuronal stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells. Although these studies show promising results, it remains to be determined whether the beneficial effect of cell-based therapies in ischemic brain injury results from direct replacement of damaged cells by the transplanted cells. On the basis of the current literature we propose that neuroprotection by activation of anti-apoptotic mechanisms as well as improvement of the trophic milieu necessary for endogenous repair processes may be more important mechanisms underlying the improved functional outcome after stem cell treatment. Transplantation of native unmodified stem cells as such may not be sufficient to boost repair mechanisms provided by the endogenous stem cell population. An important aim of this review is to discuss the literature on the possible enhancement of regenerative function by combining stem cell transplantation with gene transduction into stem cells to enhance their regenerative and neuroprotective therapeutic potential. Finally, we briefly discuss the possibility of translation of this therapy to the clinic.},

These alterations were different for each pain syndrome, but overlapped in the cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, the insula and dorsal pons. These regions function as multi-integrative structures during the experience and the anticipation of pain. As it seems that chronic pain patients have a common "brain signature" in areas known to be involved in pain regulation, the question arises whether these changes are the cause or the consequence of chronic pain.

We introduce a multiple input deep regression model to predict the CF latent embedding vectors of items based on their textual description and metadata. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed model by predicting the CF vectors of movies and apps based on their textual descriptions.

abstract = {MR-based brain imaging technologies provide a suite of functional and structural metrics that can be used to test hypotheses about the CNS mechanisms underlying pain perception and chronification, from a cellular level to a systems level. Two types of functional MRI discussed in this review provide insight into pain mechanisms: stimulus-evoked fMRI and task-free ("resting state") fMRI. The former can assess how the brain responds to noxious or non-noxious stimuli normally or in a chronic pain state as a window into understanding pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. The latter can assess functional connectivity reflecting synchronous ultra-slow frequency oscillation between brain areas. This provides insight into how brain areas work together as networks to produce pain and how these networks may be modified due to chronic pain. Perfusion MR (e.g., arterial spin labeling) can also provide task-free information pertaining to ongoing brain activity that may reflect spontaneous (ongoing) chronic pain. Structural MR techniques can be used to delineate gray and white matter abnormalities and markers of neuroinflammation associated with chronic pains. Functional and structural MRI findings point to brain and peripheral nerve abnormalities in patients with chronic pain, some of which are pre-existing and others that develop with prolonged pain (and related neuroinflammation) over time. Recent studies indicate that some structural brain abnormalities associated with chronic pain are reversible following effective pain treatment. These data together with findings from studies of individual differences suggest that some chronic pains arise from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities and sustained abnormal input.},

abstract = {This article examines the functional significance of Ca(2+)-dependent synaptic plasticity in relation to compromised memory function during aging. Research characterizing an age-related decline in memory for tasks that require proper hippocampal function is summarized. It is concluded that aged animals possess the mechanisms necessary for memory formation, and memory deficits, including rapid forgetting, result from more subtle changes in memory processes for memory storage or maintenance. A review of experimental studies concerning changes in hippocampal neural plasticity over the course of aging indicates that, during aging, there is a shift in mechanisms that regulate the thresholds for synaptic modification, including Ca(2+) channel function and subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent processes. The results, combined with theoretical considerations concerning synaptic modification thresholds, provide the basis for a model of age-related changes in hippocampal synaptic function. The model is employed as a foundation for interpretation of studies examining therapeutic intervention in age-related memory decline. The possible role of altered synaptic plasticity thresholds in learning and memory deficits suggests that treatments that modify synaptic plasticity may prove fruitful for the development of early therapeutic interventions in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.},

@article{Weiser2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the amount and availability of surgical care globally. We estimated the number of major operations undertaken worldwide, described their distribution, and assessed the importance of surgical care in global public-health policy.

METHODS: We gathered demographic, health, and economic data for 192 member states of WHO. Data for the rate of surgery were sought from several sources including governmental agencies, statistical and epidemiological organisations, published studies, and individuals involved in surgical policy initiatives. We also obtained per-head total expenditure on health from analyses done in 2004. Major surgery was defined as any intervention occurring in a hospital operating theatre involving the incision, excision, manipulation, or suturing of tissue, usually requiring regional or general anaesthesia or sedation. We created a model to estimate rates of major surgery for countries for which such data were unavailable, then used demographic information to calculate the total worldwide volume of surgery.

FINDINGS: We obtained surgical data for 56 (29{\%}) of 192 WHO member states. We estimated that 234.2 (95{\%} CI 187.2-281.2) million major surgical procedures are undertaken every year worldwide. Countries spending US{\$}100 or less per head on health care have an estimated mean rate of major surgery of 295 (SE 53) procedures per 100 000 population per year, whereas those spending more than {\$}1000 have a mean rate of 11 110 (SE 1300; p{\textless}0.0001). Middle-expenditure ({\$}401-1000) and high-expenditure ({\textgreater}{\$}1000) countries, accounting for 30.2{\%} of the world's population, provided 73.6{\%} (172.3 million) of operations worldwide in 2004, whereas poor-expenditure ({\textless}/={\$}100) countries account for 34.8{\%} of the global population yet undertook only 3.5{\%} (8.1 million) of all surgical procedures in 2004.

INTERPRETATION: Worldwide volume of surgery is large. In view of the high death and complication rates of major surgical procedures, surgical safety should now be a substantial global public-health concern. The disproportionate scarcity of surgical access in low-income settings suggests a large unaddressed disease burden worldwide. Public-health efforts and surveillance in surgery should be established.},

Heterologously expressed VR1 can be activated by vanilloid compounds, protons, or heat ({\textgreater}43 degrees C), but whether this channel contributes to chemical or thermal sensitivity in vivo is not known. Here, we demonstrate that sensory neurons from mice lacking VR1 are severely deficient in their responses to each of these noxious stimuli. VR1-/- mice showed normal responses to noxious mechanical stimuli but exhibited no vanilloid-evoked pain behavior, were impaired in the detection of painful heat, and showed little thermal hypersensitivity in the setting of inflammation. Thus, VR1 is essential for selective modalities of pain sensation and for tissue injury-induced thermal hyperalgesia.},

MRI scans of 851 MS patients participating in a phase III clinical trial were reviewed for the presence of gadolinium enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted images. If enhancement was present, it was documented whether this involved only the proximal or also the distal part of the fifth nerve, and whether the abnormality was unilateral or bilateral. In 24 (2.8{\%}) patients, enhancement of the trigeminal nerve was observed, and was bilateral in 16 (66.7{\%}) of those. In 19 (79.2{\%}) patients with abnormal nerves, enhancement extended to the distal part of the trigeminal nerve (into Meckel's cave). The results of this study indicate a high, probably clinically silent, incidence of trigeminal nerve demyelination in MS and frequent involvement of the peripheral type of myelin in MS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: Brain imaging studies have identified abnormal rectal-evoked responses and cortical thinning in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, it is not known whether these abnormalities are pre-existing or develop as result of long-term IBS. Therefore, we tested whether abnormal structural gray matter integrity in IBS correlates with individual disease symptoms, duration of the IBS, or the personality characteristic of pain catastrophizing. METHODS: Eleven IBS patients and 16 age-matched healthy subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness analysis were used to identify abnormalities in subcortical and cortical regions, respectively, and their correlation to individual characteristics. RESULTS: The IBS group showed increased hypothalamic gray matter and cortical thinning in the anterior midcingulate cortex compared with controls, a strong negative correlation between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex thickness and pain catastrophizing, and a positive correlation between anterior insula thickness and pain duration. In the insula, there was cortical thinning in patients with short-term IBS, but long-term IBS pain was associated with a more normal insula thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insight into IBS and chronic pain through evidence for structural changes that could fit with functional abnormalities. We report that patients with IBS have increased hypothalamic gray matter, which may be related to the association among IBS, stress, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Furthermore, we have identified some supraspinal abnormalities that may be pre-existing and contribute to vulnerability, and others that may develop over time, possibly because of chronic abnormal inputs},

abstract = {No single model of migraine explains all of the known features of the disorder. Migraine has recently been characterized as an abnormality in pain-modulating circuits in the brainstem. The periaqueductal gray appears to have a critical role in migraine genesis and has been labeled the "migraine generator." The concept of a "pain matrix," rather than a specific locus of pain, is widely accepted in the pain literature and offers a new dimension to understanding migraine. Recent neuroimaging studies of migraineurs suggest altered functional connectivity between brainstem pain-modulating circuits and cortical (limbic) centers. Numerous clinical observations suggest that limbic influences play an important role in migraine expression. We propose a model of migraine as a dysfunction of a "neurolimbic" pain network. The influence between brainstem and cortical centers is bidirectional, reflecting the bidirectional interaction of pain and mood. Neurolimbic dysfunction may increase as migraine becomes more chronic or refractory. The neurolimbic model expands the model of migraine as a dysfunction of brainstem nuclei. A neurolimbic model may help bridge a gap in understanding the migraine attack, the interictal dysfunctions of episodic migraine, the progression to chronic migraine, and the common comorbidities with other disorders (such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and mood and anxiety disorders), which may also be considered neurolimbic. A neurolimbic model of migraine may be a useful heuristic that would impact both clinical treatment and research agendas, as well as education of physicians and patients.},

Our approach combines two ideas: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data are scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, boosts performance significantly. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call the resulting model an R-CNN or Region-based Convolutional Network. Source code for the complete system is available at},

Atrophy of brain parenchyma in normal ageing is well documented, with grey matter reduction occurring across many regions known to be involved in pain processing. However, the functional consequences of these changes, in particular their contribution toward age-related differences in pain perception and report, are yet to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effects of ageing on supraspinal pain processing by comparing regional brain responses to noxious pressure stimulation in 15 young (aged 26+/-3 years) and 15 older (aged 79+/-4 years) adults. Both groups showed significant pain-related activity in a common network of areas including the insula, cingulate, posterior parietal and somatosensory cortices. However, compared with older adults, young subjects showed significantly greater activity in the contralateral putamen and caudate, which could not be accounted for by increased age-associated shrinkage in these regions. The age-related difference in pain-evoked activity seen in the present study may reflect reduced functioning of striatal pain modulatory mechanisms with advancing age},

Such a representation avoids the need for point-to-point correspondences, is robust to tract interruptions and reconnections and seamlessly handles the comparison and combination of white matter tract bundles. Moreover, being a parametric model, this approach has the potential to be defined in the Gaussian processes' parameter space, without the need for resampling the fiber bundles during the registration process. We use the similarity measure of our Gaussian process framework, which is in fact an inner product, to drive a diffeomorphic registration algorithm between two sets of homologous bundles which is not biased by point-to-point correspondences or the parametrization of the tracts. We estimate a dense deformation of the underlying white matter using the bundles as anatomical landmarks and obtain a population atlas of those fiber bundles. Finally we test our results in several different bundles obtained from in-vivo data.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The diversity of chronic pain syndromes and the methods employed to study them make integrating experimental findings challenging. This study performed coordinate-based meta-analyses using voxel-based morphometry imaging results to examine gray matter volume (GMV) differences between chronic pain patients and healthy controls. There were 12 clusters where GMV was decreased in patients compared with controls, including many regions thought to be part of the "pain matrix" of regions involved in pain perception, but also including many other regions that are not commonly regarded as pain-processing areas. The right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were the only regions noted to have increased GMV in patients. Functional characterizations were implemented using the BrainMap database to determine which behavioral domains were significantly represented in these regions. The most common behavioral domains associated with these regions were cognitive, affective, and perceptual domains. Because many of these regions are not classically connected with pain and because there was such significance in functionality outside of perception, it is proposed that many of these regions are related to the constellation of comorbidities of chronic pain, such as fatigue and cognitive and emotional impairments. Further research into the mechanisms of GMV changes could provide a perspective on these findings. PERSPECTIVE: Quantitative meta-analyses revealed structural differences between brains of individuals with chronic pain and healthy controls. These differences may be related to comorbidities of chronic pain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the reference technique for pharmacoresistant trigeminal neuralgia (TN). OBJECTIVE To establish whether the safety and efficacy of Gamma Knife surgery for recurrent TN are influenced by prior MVD. METHODS Between July 1992 and November 2010, 54 of 737 patients (45 of 497 with {\textgreater}1 year of follow-up) had a history of MVD (approximately half also with previous ablative procedure) and were operated on with Gamma Knife surgery for TN in the Timone University Hospital. A single 4-mm isocenter was positioned in the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve at a median distance of 7.6 mm (range, 3.9-11.9 mm) anterior to the emergence of the nerve. A median maximum dose of 85 Gy (range, 70-90 Gy) was delivered. RESULTS The median follow-up time was 39.5 months (range, 14.1-144.6 months). Thirty-five patients (77.8{\%}) were initially pain free in a median time of 14 days (range, 0-180 days), much lower compared with our global population of classic TN (P = .01). Their actuarial probabilities of remaining pain-free without medication at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years were 66.5{\%}, 59.1{\%}, 59.1{\%}, and 44.3{\%}. The hypoesthesia actuarial rate at 1 year was 9.1{\%} and remained stable until 12 years (median, 8 months). CONCLUSION Patients with previous MVD showed a significantly lower probability of initial pain cessation compared with our global population with classic TN (P = .01). The toxicity was low (only 9.1{\%} hypoesthesia); furthermore, no patient reported bothersome hypoesthesia. However, the probability of maintaining pain relief without medication was 44.3{\%} at 10 years, similar to our global series of classic TN (P = .85).},

abstract = {We propose a technique to simultaneously estimate the local fiber orientations and perform multi-fiber tractography. Existing techniques estimate the local fiber orientation at each voxel independently so there is no running knowledge of confidence in the measured signal or estimated fiber orientation. Further, to overcome noise, many algorithms use a filter as a post-processing step to obtain a smooth trajectory. We formulate fiber tracking as causal estimation: at each step of tracing the fiber, the current estimate of the signal is guided by the previous. To do this, we model the signal as a discrete mixture of Watson directional functions and perform tractography within a filtering framework. Starting from a seed point, each fiber is traced to its termination using an unscented Kalman filter to simultaneously fit the signal and propagate in the most consistent direction. Despite the presence of noise and uncertainty, this provides an accurate estimate of the local structure at each point along the fiber. We choose the Watson function since it provides a compact representation of the signal parameterized by the principal diffusion direction and a scaling parameter describing anisotropy, and also allows analytic reconstruction of the oriented diffusion function from those parameters. Using a mixture of two and three components (corresponding to two-fiber and three-fiber models) we demonstrate in synthetic experiments that this approach reduces signal reconstruction error and significantly improves the angular resolution at crossings and branchings. In vivo experiments examine the corpus callosum and internal capsule and confirm the ability to trace through regions known to contain such crossing and branching while providing inherent path regularization.},

This interoceptive system, associated with autonomic motor control, is distinct from the exteroceptive system (cutaneous mechanoreception and proprioception) that guides somatic motor activity. The primary interoceptive representation in the dorsal posterior insula engenders distinct highly resolved feelings from the body that include pain, temperature, itch, sensual touch, muscular and visceral sensations, vasomotor activity, hunger, thirst, and 'air hunger'. In humans, a meta-representation of the primary interoceptive activity is engendered in the right anterior insula, which seems to provide the basis for the subjective image of the material self as a feeling (sentient) entity, that is, emotional awareness.},

abstract = {There are two essential components of pain: discriminative and affective. The discriminative component includes the ability to identify the stimulus as originating from somatic or visceral tissue, determine some of the physical properties of the stimulus, and localize it in space, time, and along a continuum of intensities. The affective component is the experience of aversiveness which motivates escape, avoidance, and protective behavior. Both of these components of pain were acknowledged by Sir Charles Sherrington (1947) and must be considered in any discussion of the neurophysiological basis of pain. The neural mechanisms subserving discrimination and affect are different and may be differentially affected by drugs or surgical procedures. A consideration of pain mechanisms must also include the neural systems modulating pain, for it is well known that pain can be profoundly influenced by other somatic stimuli and by attentional, emotional, and cognitive factors. A thorough and detailed discussion of pain mechanisms is beyond the scope of this brief overview, but I will cover major features of the neural mechanisms currently thought to underlie the discriminative and affective dimensions of pain and the mechanisms by which pain may be modulated.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods are widely used to reconstruct white matter trajectories and to quantify tissue changes using the average diffusion properties of each brain voxel. Spherical deconvolution (SD) methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of the diffusion tensor model in resolving crossing fibers and to improve tractography reconstructions. However, the use of SD methods to obtain quantitative indices of white matter integrity has not been extensively explored. In this study, we show that the hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA) index, defined as the absolute amplitude of each lobe of the fiber orientation distribution, can be used as a compact measure to characterize the diffusion properties along each fiber orientation in white matter regions with complex organization. We demonstrate that the HMOA is highly sensitive to changes in fiber diffusivity (e.g., myelination processes or axonal loss) and to differences in the microstructural organization of white matter like axonal diameter and fiber dispersion. Using simulations to describe diffusivity changes observed in normal brain development and disorders, we observed that the HMOA is able to identify white matter changes that are not detectable with conventional DTI indices. We also show that the HMOA index can be used as an effective threshold for in vivo data to improve tractography reconstructions and to better map white matter complexity inside the brain. In conclusion, the HMOA represents a true tract-specific and sensitive index and provides a compact characterization of white matter diffusion properties with potential for widespread application in normal and clinical populations.},

abstract = {Motoneurones are particularly vulnerable both in human forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and corresponding animal models of the disease. While most motoneurone populations are selectively impaired, oculomotor neurones are essentially resistant to ALS-related damage. Motoneurone vulnerability has been closely linked to disruptions of calcium signalling. To investigate underlying events, we performed a quantitative analysis of calcium homeostasis in oculomotor neurones from mice by simultaneous patch-clamp recordings in sliced tissue and microfluorometric-calcium measurements. Somatic calcium dynamics were investigated by using a computer-controlled microfluorometric system. In oculomotor neurones, basal calcium concentrations were around 80 nM and depolarisation-induced calcium responses were observed for membrane voltages positive to -40 u1u1u approximately mV1 approximately . Endogenous calcium homeostasis was quantified by using the 'added buffer' approach. The recovery phase of depolarisation-induced calcium transients was well approximated by a mono-exponential function with a decay time constant that showed a linear dependence on dye concentration. The extrapolated time constant in the absence of indicator dye was 1.7 +/- 0.2 s (n = 11 cells, 21C). Endogenous calcium binding ratios (kappa(s)) were found to be 264 +/- 25 (n = 11 cells), indicating that 99.6 {\%} of cytosolic calcium ions were taken up by endogenous buffers. Recovery of calcium transients was characterised by an 'effective' extrusion rate gamma = 156 +/- 20 s-1 (n = 11 cells, 21 C). Endogenous calcium binding ratios in oculomotor neurones were 5- to 6-fold larger compared with those of more vulnerable motoneurones in the nucleus hypoglossus and spinal cord. In a first order approximation, they reduced the volume of local calcium elevations around open calcium channels, lowered peak amplitudes of global calcium transients for a given influx and prolonged calcium recovery times for a given set of uptake and extrusion mechanisms. With respect to motoneurone degeneration, our measurements suggest that the exceptional stability of oculomotor neurones partially results from a specialised calcium homeostasis based on high buffering capacities. Furthermore, they indicate that cellular adaptations that account for rapid calcium signalling in hypoglossal and spinal motoneurones enhance their vulnerability during ALS-related motoneurone disease.},

abstract = {Q-ball imaging (QBI) has been proposed for the mapping of multiple intravoxel fiber structures using the Funk-Radon transform on high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI). However, the accuracy and the angular resolution of QBI to define fiber orientations and its dependence on diffusion imaging parameters remain unclear. The phantom models, made up of sheets of parallel capillaries filled with water, were designed to evaluate the accuracy and the angular resolution of QBI at different |q| values. With an inner diameter of 20 mum and an outer diameter of 90 mum, the capillaries afforded a restrictive environment compared with the diffusion measurement scale. Further, the angular resolutions of QBI at various |q| value were also quantified on the corpus callosum in the human brain. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main lobe of normalized orientation distribution function (nODF) was calculated and adopted to quantify the angular resolution of QBI. With the phantom model, a higher |q| value resulted in worse accuracy but better angular resolution for QBI. The same trend where a higher |q| value yielded a better angular resolution was also observed in the human study. Upon comparison of QBI with T2WI, QBI with |q|=277 cm(-1) (b=3000 s/mm(2)) was found to be insufficient to differentiate capillaries crossing at 45 degrees . However, when encoding with |q|=320, 358, and 392 cm(-1) (b=4000, 5000, and 6000 s/mm(2)), the deviation angles between the primary ODF and the 45 degrees phantoms were -4.91 degrees +/-2.72 degrees , -1.37 degrees +/-2.32 degrees , and -0.69 degrees +/-1.54 degrees with adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These results were consistent with the FWHM-nODF, which showed that a |q| value of 320 cm(-1) was the threshold to resolve capillaries intersecting at 45 degrees . Additionally, it was demonstrated in both the phantom model and the human brain that QBI encoding with lower |q| values may result in underestimation of the orientations of the crossing fibers. In conclusion, QBI was found to accurately resolve crossing fiber orientations and was highly dependent on the selected |q| value.},

abstract = {Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) has become one of the most widely used methods to extract white matter (WM) fibre orientation information from diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high quality fibre orientation distribution function (fODF) estimates and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain apparent fibre density (AFD) measures. Unfortunately, CSD typically only supports data acquired on a single shell in q-space. With multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent, there is a growing need for CSD to fully support such data. Furthermore, CSD can only provide high quality fODF estimates in voxels containing WM only. In voxels containing other tissue types such as grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the WM response function may no longer be appropriate and spherical deconvolution produces unreliable, noisy fODF estimates. The aim of this study is to incorporate support for multi-shell data into the CSD approach as well as to exploit the unique b-value dependencies of the different tissue types to estimate a multi-tissue ODF. The resulting approach is dubbed multi-shell, multi-tissue CSD (MSMT-CSD) and is compared to the state-of-the-art single-shell, single-tissue CSD (SSST-CSD) approach. Using both simulations and real data, we show that MSMT-CSD can produce reliable WM/GM/CSF volume fraction maps, directly from the DW data, whereas SSST-CSD has a tendency to overestimate the WM volume in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. In addition, compared to SSST-CSD, MSMT-CSD can substantially increase the precision of the fODF fibre orientations and reduce the presence of spurious fODF peaks in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. Both effects translate into more reliable AFD measures and tractography results with MSMT-CSD compared to SSST-CSD.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation of the basal ganglia and other brain regions has been used successfully to treat a variety of neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms by which it works, remain unclear. In a previous study, we showed that locally delivered single current pulses delivered from a nearby microelectrode are sufficient to inhibit firing in the internal globus pallidus for tens of milliseconds. The GPi and the substantia nigra pars reticulata are the output nuclei of the basal ganglia and share many anatomical and physiological features. The goal of the current study was to examine the after-effects of trains of high-frequency microstimulation on neuronal firing in the GPi of Parkinson's disease and dystonia patients as well as in the SNr of PD patients. Microelectrode recordings and microstimulation were performed in a total of 57 patients during stereotactic surgery. We found that firing in the GPi and SNr is inhibited for several hundreds of milliseconds following the end of a short, 200 Hz high-frequency train delivered through the recording electrode (e.g., on average 618 ms when stimulating in the SNr with a 0.5 s train of 4 microA pulses at 200 Hz). Inhibition duration usually increased with increasing current intensity, train frequency and generally peaked for trains of 1-2 s, while it decreased with increasing train durations. Statistical analysis with general linear models revealed a significant linear relationship between current intensity and inhibition duration in all nuclei and patient groups. There was also a significant relationship between train frequency and inhibition duration in the SNr and GPi of PD patients and between train duration and inhibition duration in the GPi of PD patients. There was no significant difference in inhibition duration across patient groups but the current threshold for inhibition was significantly different in the SNr compared to the GPi. The characteristics of the inhibition observed are consistent with stimulation-induced GABA release following activation of the GABAergic afferents in the SNr and GPi. The findings suggest that high-frequency microstimulation of the GPi and SNr depresses local neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, and such mechanisms may contribute to the therapeutic effects of DBS.},

Given that cortical volume is a product of thickness and surface area, it is plausible that measures of volume capture at least 2 distinct sets of genetic influences. The present study aims to examine the genetic relationships between measures of cortical surface area and thickness. Participants were men in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (110 monozygotic pairs and 92 dizygotic pairs). Mean age was 55.8 years (range: 51-59). Bivariate twin analyses were utilized in order to estimate the heritability of cortical surface area and thickness, as well as their degree of genetic overlap. Total cortical surface area and average cortical thickness were both highly heritable (0.89 and 0.81, respectively) but were essentially unrelated genetically (genetic correlation = 0.08). This pattern was similar at the lobar and regional levels of analysis. These results demonstrate that cortical volume measures combine at least 2 distinct sources of genetic influences. We conclude that using volume in a genetically informative study, or as an endophenotype for a disorder, may confound the underlying genetic architecture of brain structure},

abstract = {In the past two decades, structural and functional neuroimaging findings have greatly modified longstanding notions regarding the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neuroimaging studies have shown that anatomical and functional lesions spread beyond precentral cortices and corticospinal tracts, to include the corpus callosum; frontal, sensory, and premotor cortices; thalamus; and midbrain. Both MRI and PET studies have shown early and diffuse loss of inhibitory cortical interneurons in the motor cortex (increased levels of functional connectivity and loss of GABAergic neurons, respectively) and diffuse gliosis in white-matter tracts. In ALS endophenotypes, neuroimaging has also shown a diverse spreading of lesions and a dissimilar impairment of functional and structural connections. A possible role of PET in the diagnosis of ALS has recently been proposed. However, most neuroimaging studies have pitfalls, such as a small number and poor clinical characterisation of patients, absence of adequate controls, and scarcity of longitudinal assessments. Studies involving international collaborations, standardised assessments, and large patient cohorts will overcome these shortcomings and provide further insight into the pathogenesis of ALS.},

We observed enhanced activity in insula, somatomotor and cingulate cortices. In right anterior insular/opercular cortex, neural activity predicted subjects' accuracy in the heartbeat detection task. Furthermore, local gray matter volume in the same region correlated with both interoceptive accuracy and subjective ratings of visceral awareness.

abstract = {Variability in human behavior related to sex is supported by neuroimaging studies showing differences in brain activation patterns during cognitive task performance. An emerging field is examining the human connectome, including networks of brain regions that are not only temporally-correlated during different task conditions, but also networks that show highly correlated spontaneous activity during a task-free state. Both task-related and task-free network activity has been associated with individual task performance and behavior under certain conditions. Therefore, our aim was to determine whether sex differences exist during a task-free resting state for two networks associated with cognitive task performance (executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN)) and the default mode network (DMN). Forty-nine healthy subjects (26 females, 23 males) underwent a 5-min task-free fMRI scan in a 3T MRI. An independent components analysis (ICA) was performed to identify the best-fit IC for each network based on specific spatial nodes defined in previous studies. To determine the consistency of these networks across subjects we performed self-organizing group-level ICA analyses. There were no significant differences between sexes in the functional connectivity of the brain areas within the ECN, SN, or the DMN. These important findings highlight the robustness of intrinsic connectivity of these resting state networks and their similarity between sexes. Furthermore, our findings suggest that resting state fMRI studies do not need to be controlled for sex.},

abstract = {Although depressive mood is an important psychological determinate of chronic pain, the neural circuitry that mediates its influence on the pain experience is largely unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to investigate the neurophysiological interactions between depressive symptoms and disease-relevant pain in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. RA is associated with chronic joint pain and swelling, but peripheral joint pathology often does not fully explain the amount of pain a patient experiences. We investigated the neural circuitry that relates joint pain and depressive symptoms and contrasted this with experimental heat pain. We hypothesized that (1) depressive symptoms influence the cerebral processing of provoked joint pain in RA, and (2) the interaction of depressive symptoms with pain processing contributes to the pain RA patients experience on a daily basis. Twenty patients underwent whole brain FMRI during which disease-relevant joint pain was provoked. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The tender-to-swollen joint ratio (T/S) was assessed as one component of the patients' clinical pain. BDI scores correlated significantly with T/S and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activation during provoked joint pain. The association between BDI scores and T/S was partly mediated by the MPFC activation. Furthermore, the MPFC activation co-varied significantly with the FMRI signal in limbic areas and in areas that process self-relevant information. These results suggest that the MPFC may play an important role in mediating the relationship between depressive symptoms and clinical pain severity in RA, possibly by engaging brain areas important for affective and self-relevant processing},

abstract = {Language ability and handedness are likely to be associated with asymmetry of the cerebral cortex (grey matter) and connectivity (white matter). Grey matter asymmetry, most likely linked to language has been identified with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using T(1)-weighted images. Differences in white matter obtained with this technique are less consistent, probably due to the relative insensitivity of the T(1) contrast to the ultrastructure of white matter. Furthermore, previous VBM studies failed to find differences related to handedness in either grey or white matter. We revisited these issues and investigated two independent groups of subjects with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) for asymmetries in white matter composition. Using voxel-based statistical analyses an asymmetry of the arcuate fascicle was observed, with higher fractional anisotropy in the left hemisphere. In addition, we show differences related to handedness in the white matter underneath the precentral gyrus contralateral to the dominant hand. Remarkably, these findings were very robust, even when investigating small groups of subjects. This highlights the sensitivity of DTI for white matter tissue differences, making it an ideal tool to study small patient populations.},

abstract = {The somatic sensory system includes a variety of sensory modalities, such as touch, pain, itch, and temperature sensitivity. The coding of these modalities appears to be best explained by the population-coding theory, which is composed of the following features. First, an individual somatic sensory afferent is connected with a specific neural circuit or network (for simplicity, a sensory-labeled line), whose isolated activation is sufficient to generate one specific sensation under normal conditions. Second, labeled lines are interconnected through local excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. As a result, activation of one labeled line could modulate, or provide gate control of, another labeled line. Third, most sensory fibers are polymodal, such that a given stimulus placed onto the skin often activates two or multiple sensory-labeled lines; crosstalk among them is needed to generate one dominant sensation. Fourth and under pathological conditions, a disruption of the antagonistic interaction among labeled lines could open normally masked neuronal pathways, and allow a given sensory stimulus to evoke a new sensation, such as pain evoked by innocuous mechanical or thermal stimuli and itch evoked by painful stimuli. As a result of this, some sensory fibers operate along distinct labeled lines under normal versus pathological conditions. Thus, a better understanding of the neural network underlying labeled line crosstalk may provide new strategies to treat chronic pain and itch.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of potentially harmful stimuli is necessary for the well-being and self-preservation of all organisms. However, the neural substrates involved in the processing of aversive stimuli are not well understood. For instance, painful and non-painful aversive stimuli are largely thought to activate different neural networks. However, it is presently unclear whether there is a common aversion-related network of brain regions responsible for the basic processing of aversive stimuli. To help clarify this issue, this report used a cross-species translational approach in humans (i.e. meta-analysis) and rodents (i.e. systematic review of functional neuroanatomy). RESULTS: Animal and human data combined to show a core aversion-related network, consisting of similar cortical (i.e. MCC, PCC, AI, DMPFC, RTG, SMA, VLOFC; see results section or abbreviation section for full names) and subcortical (i.e. Amyg, BNST, DS, Hab, Hipp/Parahipp, Hyp, NAc, NTS, PAG, PBN, raphe, septal nuclei, Thal, LC, midbrain) regions. In addition, a number of regions appeared to be more involved in pain-related (e.g. sensory cortex) or non-pain-related (e.g. amygdala) aversive processing. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation suggests that aversive processing, at the most basic level, relies on similar neural substrates, and that differential responses may be due, in part, to the recruitment of additional structures as well as the spatio-temporal dynamic activity of the network. This network perspective may provide a clearer understanding of why components of this circuit appear dysfunctional in some psychiatric and pain-related disorders.},

abstract = {The use of functional stereotactic neurosurgery is increasing for treatment of patients with movement disorders and other chronic illnesses. The anesthetic considerations include the influence of the anesthetic agents on the microelectrode recordings and stimulation testing of an awake patient. The purpose of this study was to review the anesthetic management and incidences of intraoperative complications during functional neurosurgery in our institution. One hundred seventy-eight patients underwent an ablative procedure (n = 6) or the insertion of deep brain stimulator (n = 172) under monitored anesthesia care for movement disorders (n = 124), chronic pain (n = 20), and other procedures (n = 34). Local anesthetic was used for head frame pin sites and burr holes. No sedation/analgesia was administered to 57 (32{\%}) patients. One patient required conscious sedation and another general anesthesia for the entire procedure. The remainder received small increments (mean SD) of propofol (113 73 mg), midazolam (1.6 0.8 mg), and/or fentanyl (93 55 mug). Intraoperative complications that occurred in 16{\%} of the patients included seizures (n = 8), change in neurologic status (n = 5), airway obstruction (n = 2), and hypertension (n = 7). Functional neurosurgery can be performed with minimal anesthesia in many patients. Awareness and vigilance can improve the identification and early treatment of intraoperative complications such as seizures, loss of airway, and changes in the neurologic status.},

abstract = {Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is the treatment of choice for osteoarthritis. However, to regenerate articular cartilage using this method, the procedure paradoxically demands that the cell source of the articular chondrocytes (ACs) for ex vivo expansion be from the patient's own healthy cartilage, which can result in donor site morbidity. Accordingly, it is essential to develop a substitute for AC. In the present study, we investigated whether synovium-derived cells (SYs) could be used as a partial replacement for ACs in ACI. ACs and SYs from the knees of rabbits were isolated and cultured, and the growth rates of the cells were compared. To manufacture the cellular transplants, we developed a high-density suspension-shaking culture method (HDSS), which circulates the cells in culture media, promoting self-assembly of scaffold-free cellular aggregates. ACs and SYs were mixed in various ratios using HDSS. Injectable cellular transplants were harvested and transplanted into full-thickness osteochondral defects. Simultaneously, histological evaluations were conducted with toluidine blue and safranin O, and immunohistochemistry of collagen type I and II was conducted. Gene expression to evaluate chondrocyte-specific differentiation was also performed. We successfully prepared a large quantity of spheroids (spheroidal cell aggregates) in a short time using mixed ACs and SYs, for all cellular composition ratios. Our data showed that the minimal therapeutic unit for the transplants contributed to in situ regeneration of cartilage. In summary, SYs can be used as a replacement for ACs in clinical cases of ACI in patients with broad areas of osteoarthritic lesions.},

Effective treatment for neuropathic pain is still lacking, due in part to poor understanding of pathological mechanisms at the molecular level. Neuronal mechanisms of neuropathic pain, especially synaptic plasticity, are the major focus of many investigators. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dependent synaptic plasticity at the spinal and cortical levels is believed to contribute to enhanced sensory responses after injury. Glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, have recently been implicated in neuropathic pain. These glial cells form close interactions with neurons and thus may modulate nociceptive transmission under pathological conditions. In this review, we present recent progress in the study of neuronal and microglial mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain. We propose that activity-dependent neuronal plasticity is a key target for treatment in neuropathic pain},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To preoperatively visualize the course of the facial nerve, which is displaced by vestibular schwannoma, using diffusion tensor (DT) tractography, and to evaluate the agreement with surgical findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects were eight patients with vestibular schwannoma who had undergone removal surgery. DT MR images were obtained and tracts that were considered to represent the facial nerve were constructed. We assessed the success rate for tract construction and evaluated the agreement between tractography findings and surgery. RESULTS: We obtained a tract that connected the internal auditory meatus and brainstem, and was considered to represent the facial nerve in seven of eight cases. The course of the constructed tract agreed with surgical findings in five of these seven cases. One exception was a case in which the tumor was too large to enable intraoperative observation of the facial nerve; however, the facial nerve appeared to be displaced anteriorly at intracapsular resection, in agreement with tractography. In the other case, the schwannoma was mostly cystic. CONCLUSION: Tractographs constructed using MR tensor images enabled us to identify tracts considered to represent facial nerves. We consider DT tractography to be a useful tool for preoperatively predicting facial nerve displacement in vestibular schwannoma.},

This study investigates the feasibility of using known macaque anatomical connectivity as a "gold-standard" for the evaluation of DTI tractography methods. Connectivity information is determined from the DTI data using fast marching tractography (FMT), a novel tract-tracing (tractography) method. We show for the first time that it is possible to determine, in an entirely noninvasive manner, anatomical connection pathways and maps of an anatomical connectivity metric in the macaque brain using a standard clinical scanner and that these pathways are consistent with known anatomy. Analogous human anatomical connectivity is also presented for the first time using the FMT method, and the results are compared. The current limitations of the methodology and possibilities available for further studies are discussed},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging and promising tool to provide information about the course of white matter fiber tracts in the human brain. Based on specific acquisition schemes, diffusion tensor data resemble local fiber orientations allowing for a reconstruction of the fiber bundles. Current techniques to calculate fascicles range from simple heuristic tracking solutions to Bayesian and differential equations approaches. Most methods are based only on local diffusion information, often resulting in bending or kinking fiber paths in voxels with reduced diffusion properties. In this article we present a new tracking approach based on linear state space models encompassing an inherent smoothness criterion to avoid too wiggly tracked fiber bundles. The new technique will be described formally and tested on simulated and real data. The performance tests are focused on the pyramidal tract, where we employed a test-retest study and a group comparison in healthy subjects. Anatomical course was confirmed in a patient with selective degeneration of the pyramidal tract. The potential of the presented technique for improved neurosurgical planning is demonstrated by visualization of a tumor-induced displacement of the motor pathways. The paper closes with a thorough discussion of perspectives and limitations of the new tracking approach.},

AIMS: To examine whether ACC morphological anomalies are present in a group at ultra-high risk of psychosis and whether such anomalies can be used to predict the subsequent development of a psychotic illness. METHOD: Magnetic resonance imaging of 75 healthy volunteers and 63 people at ultra-high risk of developing a psychotic disorder (all right-handed males) was used to examine ACC sulcal and gyral features. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, significantly fewer people in the ultra-high risk group had a well-developed left paracingulate sulcus and significantly more had an interrupted left cingulate sulcus. There was no difference between those who did (n=21) and did not (n=42) subsequently develop a psychotic illness. CONCLUSIONS: Although ACC anomalies are present in young people considered to be at ultra-high risk of psychosis, they do not identify individuals who subsequently make the transition to psychosis},

abstract = {To estimate diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) measures, such as fractional anisotropy and fiber orientation, reliably, a large number of diffusion-encoded images is needed, preferably cardiac gated to reduce pulsation artifacts. However, the concomitant longer acquisition times increase the chances of subject motion adversely affecting the estimation of these measures. While correcting for motion artifacts improves the accuracy of DTI, an often overlooked step in realigning the images is to reorient the B-matrix so that orientational information is correctly preserved. To the best of our knowledge, most research groups and software packages currently omit this reorientation step. Given the recent explosion of DTI applications including, for example, neurosurgical planning (in which errors can have drastic consequences), it is important to investigate the impact of neglecting to perform the B-matrix reorientation. In this work, a systematic study to investigate the effect of neglecting to reorient the B-matrix on DTI data during motion correction is presented. The consequences for diffusion fiber tractography are also discussed.},

@article{Lorenz2005,
abstract = {Pain subserves different functions. Acute pain from the intact body alerts the victim to immediately react and withdraw from the bodily threat, ideally before an injury happens. However, during manifest injury and tissue inflammation, withdrawal and flight are no longer adaptive. Instead, sparing the affected body part to promote healing requires heightened awareness and avoidance behaviour over longer periods of time. Quality and time scales of behavioural adaptations are therefore substantially different between pain during normal compared to abnormal tissue states. Given these functional differences we postulated that the two phenomena also recruit different forebrain systems. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and subtracted scans obtained during painful heating of normal skin from scans during equally intense but normally non-painful heating of capsaicin-treated skin. This comparison reveals the specific activation of a medial thalamic pathway to limbic forebrain structures such as anterior insula, perigenual anterior cingulate, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex during pain originating in the chemically sensitised skin. It is possible that the unique forebrain recruitment by pain under a patho-physiological tissue status is caused by a significantly greater facilitation of the multi-synaptic projections from the spino-parabrachial tract of the superficial dorsal horn to the medial thalamus compared to deeper and direct lateral thalamic projections from the spino-thalamic tract. ?? 2004 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the accuracy and preoperative diagnostic value of these high-resolution imaging techniques in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, in a single-blind study. The preoperative MRI images of 21 consecutive patients were matched to one neuroradiologist, who was blind as to which side exhibited the symptoms. The images and post-processing multiplanar reconstructions were compared with the video-documented operative observations. HR-MRI using only 3D-FSPGR sequences demonstrated neurovascular compression in accordance with the intraoperative finding in 11 patients (52.4{\%}). In the subgroup where, additionally, 3D-FIESTA sequences were available, neurovascular compression was in accordance with the intraoperative finding in 71.4{\%} (n = 7). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging using double-dose contrast-enhanced 3D-FSPGR and 3D-FIESTA sequences is currently not sufficient enough to make an accurate prediction of neurovascular compression in a single-blind setting. These 3D imaging techniques currently provide only limited information, and one should consider their use carefully when identifying patients with trigeminal neuralgia from operation until image quality is improved by superior image resolution that can accurately discriminate vessels surrounding the trigeminal root entry zone},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 1{\%} to 2{\%} of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) develop trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Percutaneous surgery is commonly performed in medically refractory cases. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the pain outcomes and complications of patients with MS-related trigeminal neuralgia (MS-TN) having percutaneous surgery. METHODS: Patients having balloon microcompression (BMC; n = 69) or glycerol rhizotomy (PRGR; n = 67) from 1997 to 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients in the 2 groups were similar with regard to age, sex, pain location, and pain quality. Mean pain duration was longer in the PRGR group (54.6 vs 16 months; P {\textless} .001); more patients having BMC had prior surgery (87{\%} vs. 48{\%}; P {\textless} .001). Outcomes were defined as excellent (no pain, no medications), good (no pain with medications), and poor. Median follow-up was 13 months (range, 0.25-132 months). RESULTS: Ninety-five patients initially had excellent (n = 45, 33{\%}) or good (n = 50, 37{\%}) outcomes. Pain relief was maintained in 58{\%} of patients at 3 months and 28{\%} at 2 years. There was no difference in excellent/good outcomes between the surgical groups (hazard ratio = 0.73; P = .14). No correlation was noted between pain relief and new or increased facial numbness (hazard ratio = 0.78; P = .19). Forty-four BMC patients (64{\%}) had additional surgery compared with 36 PRGR patients (54{\%}; P = .19). Complications were more frequent after BMC (17.4{\%} vs 3.0{\%}; P {\textless} .01). CONCLUSION: Percutaneous surgery for patients with MS-TN is less likely to provide pain relief than similar operations performed for patients with idiopathic TN. New trigeminal deficits did not correlate with better facial pain outcomes, supporting the concept that many patients with MS-TN have centrally mediated pain},

Indeed, many IRF members play central roles in the cellular differentiation of hematopoietic cells and in the regulation of gene expression in response to pathogen-derived danger signals. In particular, the advances made in understanding the immunobiology of Toll-like and other pattern-recognition receptors have recently generated new momentum for the study of IRFs. Moreover, the role of several IRF family members in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis has important implications for understanding susceptibility to and progression of several cancers.},

abstract = {Neuropathic pain can be both ongoing or stimulus-induced. Stimulus-induced pain, also known as hyperalgesia, can be differentiated into primary and secondary hyperalgesia. The former results from sensitization of peripheral nociceptive structures, the latter involves sensitization processes within the central nervous system (CNS). Hypersensitivity towards heat stimuli, i.e. thermal hyperalgesia, is a key feature of primary hyperalgesia, whereas secondary hyperalgesia is characterized by hypersensitivity towards mechanical (e.g. pin-prick) stimulation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated if brain activation patterns associated with primary and secondary hyperalgesia might differ. Thermal and pin-prick hyperalgesia were induced on the left forearm in 12 healthy subjects by topical capsaicin (2.5{\%}, 30 min) application. Equal pain intensities of both hyperalgesia types were applied during fMRI experiments, based on previous quantitative sensory testing. Simultaneously, subjects had to rate the unpleasantness of stimulus-related pain. Pin-prick hyperalgesia (i.e. subtraction of brain activations during pin-prick stimulation before and after capsaicin exposure) led to activations of primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2), associative-somatosensory cortices, insula and superior and inferior frontal cortices (SFC, IFC). Brain areas activated during thermal hyperalgesia (i.e. subtraction of brain activations during thermal stimulation before and after capsaicin exposure) were S1 and S2, insula, associative-somatosensory cortices, cingulate cortex (GC), SFC, middle frontal cortex (MFC) and IFC. When compared to pin-prick hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia led to an increased activation of bilateral anterior insular cortices, MFC, GC (Brodmann area 24' and 32') and contralateral SFC and IFC, despite equal pain intensities. Interestingly, stronger activations of GC, contralateral MFC and anterior insula significantly correlated to higher ratings of the stimulus-related unpleasantness. We conclude that thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia produce substantially different brain activation patterns. This is linked to different psychophysical properties.},

abstract = {Readout-segmented echo planar imaging with 2D navigator-based reacquisition is an uprising technique enabling the sampling of high-resolution diffusion images with reduced susceptibility artifacts. However, low signal from the small voxels and long scan times hamper the clinical applicability. Therefore, we introduce a regularization algorithm based on total variation that is applied directly on the entire diffusion tensor. The spatially varying regularization parameter is determined automatically dependent on spatial variations in signal-to-noise ratio thus, avoiding over- or under-regularization. Information about the noise distribution in the diffusion tensor is extracted from the diffusion weighted images by means of complex independent component analysis. Moreover, the combination of those features enables processing of the diffusion data absolutely user independent. Tractography from in vivo data and from a software phantom demonstrate the advantage of the spatially varying regularization compared to un-regularized data with respect to parameters relevant for fiber-tracking such as Mean Fiber Length, Track Count, Volume and Voxel Count. Specifically, for in vivo data findings suggest that tractography results from the regularized diffusion tensor based on one measurement (16 min) generates results comparable to the un-regularized data with three averages (48 min). This significant reduction in scan time renders high resolution (1×1×2.5 mm(3)) diffusion tensor imaging of the entire brain applicable in a clinical context.},

abstract = {In Parkinson's disease (PD), there are alterations of the basal ganglia (BG) thalamocortical networks, primarily due to degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. These changes in subcortical networks lead to plastic changes in primary motor cortex (M1), which mediates cortical motor output and is a potential target for treatment of PD. Studies investigating the motor cortical plasticity using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have found altered plasticity in PD, but there are inconsistencies among these studies. This is likely because plasticity depends on many factors such as the extent of dopaminergic loss and disease severity, response to dopaminergic replacement therapies, development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID), the plasticity protocol used, medication, and stimulation status in patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). The influences of LID and DBS on BG and M1 plasticity have been explored in animal models and in PD patients. In addition, many other factors such age, genetic factors (e.g., brain derived neurotropic factor and other neurotransmitters or receptors polymorphism), emotional state, time of the day, physical fitness have been documented to play role in the extent of plasticity induced by TMS in human studies. In this review, we summarize the studies that investigated M1 plasticity in PD and demonstrate how these afore-mentioned factors affect motor cortical plasticity in PD. We conclude that it is important to consider the clinical, demographic, and technical factors that influence various plasticity protocols while developing these protocols as diagnostic or prognostic tools in PD. We also discuss how the modulation of cortical excitability and the plasticity with these non-invasive brain stimulation techniques facilitate the understanding of the pathophysiology of PD and help design potential therapeutic possibilities in this disorder.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging analysis using structural data has begun to provide insights into the pathophysiology of headache syndromes. Several independent studies have suggested a decrease in grey matter in pain-transmitting areas in migraine patients. Most of these data are discussed as damage or loss of brain grey matter, reinforcing the idea of migraine as a progressive disease. However, given what we know about the nature of morphometric changes detectable by the methods we have to date, this interpretation is highly speculative and not supported by the data. It is likely that these changes are the consequence and not the cause of the respective headache syndromes, as they are probably not irreversible and only mirror the proportion or duration of pain suffered. Moreover, structural changes are not headache specific and have to be seen in the light of a wealth of pain studies using these methods. The studies in cluster headache patients prompted the use of stereotactic stimulation of the hypothalamic target point identified by functional and structural neuroimaging. Due to the nature of the methods used and due to a high anatomical variance it is more than questionable to use this point as a definite answer to the source of the headache in clusters and even more so when it is uncritically used in individuals. We need a way to study each patient individually using the functional imaging method with the highest spatial and temporal resolution available to enable us to target the seed point for deep brain stimulation on this individual basis. One of the major future challenges is to understand the behavioural consequences and cellular mechanisms underlying neuroanatomic changes in pain and headache.},

A novel and comprehensive approach to correct for spatial misalignment of DW imaging (DWI) volumes acquired with different strengths and orientations of the diffusion sensitizing gradients is presented. This approach uses a mutual information-based registration technique and a spatial transformation model containing parameters that correct for eddy current-induced image distortion and rigid body motion in three dimensions. All parameters are optimized simultaneously for an accurate and fast solution to the registration problem. The images can also be registered to a normalized template with a single interpolation step without additional computational cost. Following registration, the signal amplitude of each DWI volume is corrected to account for size variations of the object produced by the distortion correction, and the b-matrices are properly recalculated to account for any rotation applied during registration. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that this approach produces a significant improvement of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data acquired in the human brain.},

Fifty patients at five centers underwent radio-surgery performed with a single 4-mm isocenter targeted at the nerve root entry zone. Thirty-two patients had undergone prior surgery, and the mean number of procedures that had been performed was 2.8 (range 1-7). The target dose of the radiosurgery used in the current study varied from 60 to 90 Gy. The median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 18 months (range 11-36 months). Twenty-nine patients (58{\%}) responded with excellent control (pain free), 18 (36{\%}) obtained good control (50{\%}-90{\%} relief), and three (6{\%}) experienced treatment failure. The median time to pain relief was 1 month (range 1 day-6.7 months). Responses remained consistent for up to 3 years postradiosurgery in all cases except three (6{\%}) in which the patients had pain recurrence at 5, 7, and 10 months. At 2 years, 54{\%} of patients were pain free and 88{\%} had 50{\%} to 100{\%} relief. A maximum radiosurgical dose of 70 Gy or greater was associated with a significantly greater chance of complete pain relief (72{\%} vs. 9{\%}, p = 0.0003). Three patients (6{\%}) developed increased facial paresthesia after radiosurgery, which resolved totally in one case and improved in another. No patient developed other deficits or deafferentation pain. The proximal trigeminal nerve and root entry zone, which is well defined on magnetic resonance imaging, is an appropriate anatomical target for radiosurgery. Radiosurgery using the gamma unit is an additional effective surgical approach for the management of medically or surgically refractory trigeminal neuralgia.

abstract = {Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent health problems in the world today, yet neurological markers, critical to diagnosis of chronic pain, are still largely unknown. The ability to objectively identify individuals with chronic pain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is important for the advancement of diagnosis, treatment, and theoretical knowledge of brain processes associated with chronic pain. The purpose of our research is to investigate specific neurological markers that could be used to diagnose individuals experiencing chronic pain by using multivariate pattern analysis with fMRI data. We hypothesize that individuals with chronic pain have different patterns of brain activity in response to induced pain. This pattern can be used to classify the presence or absence of chronic pain. The fMRI experiment consisted of alternating 14 seconds of painful electric stimulation (applied to the lower back) with 14 seconds of rest. We analyzed contrast fMRI images in stimulation versus rest in pain-related brain regions to distinguish between the groups of participants: 1) chronic pain and 2) normal controls. We employed supervised machine learning techniques, specifically sparse logistic regression, to train a classifier based on these contrast images using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. We correctly classified 92.3{\%} of the chronic pain group (N = 13) and 92.3{\%} of the normal control group (N = 13) by recognizing multivariate patterns of activity in the somatosensory and inferior parietal cortex. This technique demonstrates that differences in the pattern of brain activity to induced pain can be used as a neurological marker to distinguish between individuals with and without chronic pain. Medical, legal and business professionals have recognized the importance of this research topic and of developing objective measures of chronic pain. This method of data analysis was very successful in correctly classifying each of the two groups.},

Although it is often used for the detection of acute ischemia, evaluation of directionality in a diffusion measurement can be useful in white matter, which demonstrates strong diffusion anisotropy. Techniques such as diffusion-tensor imaging offer a glimpse into brain microstructure at a scale that is not easily accessible with other modalities, in some cases improving the detection and characterization of white matter abnormalities. Diffusion MR tractography offers an overall view of brain anatomy, including the degree of connectivity between different regions of the brain. However, optimal utilization of the wide range of data provided with directional diffusion MR measurements requires careful attention to acquisition and postprocessing.

abstract = {Several quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) measures are used to investigate multiple sclerosis (MS) in vivo. Precise quantitative investigation of the histopathological correlates of such measures has, to date, been limited. This study investigates the relationship of quantitative measures of myelin content, axonal density, and gliosis with quantitative MR measures in postmortem (PM) MS tissue. MR imaging (MRI) was performed on a 1.5T scanner and T1-relaxation time (T1-RT) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) maps were acquired in fresh PM brain of 20 MS subjects. Myelin content, axonal counts, and the extent of gliosis all were quantified using morphometric and digital imaging techniques. MRI and pathological data were in most cases coregistered using stereotactic navigation. Using multiple regression analysis, we detected significant correlations between myelin content (Tr(myelin)) and MTR (r = -0.84, p {\textless} 0.001) and myelin content and axonal count (-0.80, p {\textless} 0.001); MTR correlated with T1-RT (r = -0.79, p {\textless} 0.001). No association was detected between the extent of gliosis and either MR measure. MTR was significantly higher in remyelinated than demyelinated lesions (means: 30.0 [standard deviation, 2.9] vs 23.8 [standard deviation, 4.3], p = 0.008). In conclusion, MTR is affected by myelin content in MS white matter.},

The causes of these category preferences are widely debated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find that the same regions of the ventral stream that show category preferences for nonliving stimuli and animals in sighted adults show the same category preferences in adults who are blind since birth. Both blind and sighted participants had larger blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in??the medial fusiform gyrus for nonliving stimuli compared to animal stimuli and differential BOLD responses in lateral occipital cortex for animal stimuli??compared to nonliving stimuli.

abstract = {Many studies have focused on defining the network of brain structures involved in normal physiological pain. The different dimensions of pain perception (i.e., sensory discriminative, affective/emotional, cognitive/evaluative) have been shown to depend on different areas of the brain. In contrast, much less is known about the neural basis of pathological chronic pain. In particular, it is unclear whether such pain results from changes to the physiological "pain matrix". We review here studies on changes in brain activity associated with neuropathic pain syndromes-a specific category of chronic pain associated with peripheral or central neurological lesions. Patients may report combinations of spontaneous pain and allodynia/hyperalgesia-abnormal pain evoked by stimuli that normally induce no/little sensation of pain. Modern neuroimaging methods (positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI (fMRI)) have been used to determine whether different neuropathic pain symptoms involve similar brain structures and whether these structures are related to the physiological "pain matrix". PET studies have suggested that spontaneous neuropathic pain is associated principally with changes in thalamic activity and the medial pain system, which is preferentially involved in the emotional dimension of pain. Both PET and fMRI have been used to investigate the basis of allodynia. The results obtained have been very variable, probably reflecting the heterogeneity of patients in terms of etiology, lesion topography, symptoms and stimulation procedures. Overall, these studies indicated that acute physiological pain and neuropathic pain have distinct although overlapping brain activation pattern, but that there is no unique "pain matrix" or "allodynia network". ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root accounts for more than 80{\%} of intractable cases of trigeminal neuralgia, but the pathogenesis is still debated. The authors report the ultrastructural changes in the trigeminal nerve root of a patient with trigeminal neuralgia, at the point of compression by a large, medially placed petrosal vein, and compare these with the findings in six cases of trigeminal neuralgia not related to vascular compression. Vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root was associated with focal loss of myelin and close apposition of the demyelinated axons with few intervening astrocytic processes. No inflammatory cells were present. Immunoelectron microscopy for glial fibrillary acid protein confirmed that astrocyte processes were largely confined to the periphery of the lesion. Of the other six rhizotomy specimens, only one, from a patient with multiple sclerosis, showed demyelination with intervening astrocyte processes, perivascular lymphocytes, and lipid-laden macrophages. These findings support the hypothesis that ephaptic transmission plays a role in the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia related to vascular compression},

abstract = {Microglia become activated by multiple types of damage in the nervous system and play essential roles in neuronal pathologies. However, how microglia transform into reactive phenotypes is poorly understood. Here, we identify the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) as a critical regulator of reactive microglia. Within the spinal cord, IRF8 expression was normally low; however, the expression was markedly upregulated in microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes, after peripheral nerve injury (PNI). IRF8 overexpression in cultured microglia promoted the transcription of genes associated with reactive states; conversely, IRF8 deficiency prevented these gene expressions in the spinal cord following PNI. Furthermore, IRF8-deficient mice were resistant to neuropathic pain, a common sequela of PNI, and transferring IRF8-overexpressing microglia spinally to normal mice produced pain. Therefore, IRF8 may activate a program of gene expression that transforms microglia into a reactive phenotype. Our findings provide a newly observed mechanism for microglial activation.},

abstract = {Cell based therapies are being investigated for biological repair of a variety of disorders. Previous work has shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from older patients have reduced proliferation rates. As age is associated with greater musculoskeletal morbidity, e.g., osteoarthritis, an optimal MSC expansion strategy is required for older patients. In this in vitro study we investigate how age and gender affect MSC proliferation rate and cell surface characterization, as well as identify a relationship between seeding density and proliferation that could be applied to therapeutic MSC uses. Synovial fat pad derived MSCs were isolated and expanded from 14 patients undergoing total knee replacements. The cells were seeded at densities between 50 and 10,000 cells/cm(2) and cell proliferation studies, flow cytometry, and cell surface staining were performed. Females were found to have consistently higher cell proliferation and cell surface marker expression. The cell surface marker CD105 had a constant expression irrespective of age. A statistically significant inverse relationship was found between seeding densities and cell proliferation rates. This study has shown that patient characteristics do effect cell proliferation rate and cell surface characterization, but as seeding density has a significant relationship with proliferation rate, it can be altered, possibly along with other cell culturing strategies, to compensate for the effects of patient factors on MSCs. We have also shown that gender affects cell proliferation and cell surface characterization, something most previous studies may have failed to identify as they group male and female patients together. {\textcopyright} 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Psychobiological sensitization and health worry appear to be involved in the etiology of clinical manifestations of subjective health complaints (SHCs) via amplified processing of health-related information. However, it is not clear whether sensitization and health worry are also associated with common SHCs, which are extremely prevalent and are responsible for a large part of both human suffering and health care costs. In this study, we investigated whether SHCs are associated with health worry and two types of sensitization: cognitive health-related sensitization and somatic sensitization. We also examined whether health worry mediates the relationship between cognitive sensitization and SHCs and whether both levels of sensitization interact. METHODS: A nonclinical sample of 47 female students completed questionnaires about their recent subjective health as well as health worry and underwent tests for cognitive sensitization, operationalized as Stroop interference and free recall performance, and somatic sensitization, operationalized as pain tolerance and pain threshold in a cold pressor task. RESULTS: Severity of health complaints was positively related with recall of health-related stimuli, but not with Stroop interference, and with worrying about health complaints. In addition, worry mediated the relationship between recall bias and severity of health complaints. Both the number and severity of recent health complaints were associated with pain tolerance. Pain threshold was associated with Stroop interference for health-related information. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that specific types of cognitive sensitization and somatic sensitization are associated with common health complaints and that worrying about one's complaints might play a role by enhancing biased memory of health-related information},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unknown whether white matter lesions (WML) develop abruptly in previously normal brain areas, or whether tissue changes are already present before WML become apparent on MRI. We therefore investigated whether development of WML is preceded by quantifiable changes in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In 689 participants from the general population (mean age 67 years), we performed 2 MRI scans (including diffusion tensor imaging and Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery [FLAIR] sequences) 3.5 years apart using the same 1.5-T scanner. Using automated tissue segmentation, we identified NAWM at baseline. We assessed which NAWM regions converted into WML during follow-up and differentiated new WML into regions of WML growth and de novo WML. Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and FLAIR intensity of regions converting to WML and regions of persistent NAWM were compared using 3 approaches: a whole-brain analysis, a regionally matched approach, and a voxel-wise approach.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All 3 approaches showed that low fractional anisotropy, high mean diffusivity, and relatively high FLAIR intensity at baseline were associated with WML development during follow-up. Compared with persistent NAWM regions, NAWM regions converting to WML had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (0.337 vs 0.387; P{\textless}0.001), higher mean diffusivity (0.910 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs 0.729 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; P{\textless}0.001), and relatively higher normalized FLAIR intensity (1.233 vs -0.340; P{\textless}0.001). This applied to both NAWM developing into growing and de novo WML.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: White matter changes in NAWM are present and can be quantified on diffusion tensor imaging and FLAIR before WML develop. This suggests that WML develop gradually, and that visually appreciable WML are only the tip of the iceberg of white matter pathology.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare constructive interference in the steady state (CISS) three-dimensional Fourier transform (3DFT) MR imaging with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo MR imaging for accuracy in detecting acoustic schwannoma. METHODS: One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with possible acoustic schwannoma were examined. The accuracy of CISS-3DFT MR imaging in detecting abnormalities of the cerebellopontine angle, the internal auditory canal, and the inner ear was compared with T1-weighted contrast-enhanced spin-echo MR imaging by independent assessment of both image sets by two observers. RESULTS: The postcontrast T1-weighted MR images revealed 18 cases of unilateral disease of the cerebellopontine angle and/or the internal auditory canal and no case of an abnormal bilateral cerebellopontine angle and/or internal auditory canal. Twelve cases were pathologically proved acoustic schwannomas. One meningioma of the cerebellopontine angle and one metastatic ependymoma to the cerebellopontine angle and the internal auditory canal was encountered. The four remaining cases had a provisional diagnosis of acoustic schwannoma and were scheduled for follow-up imaging and clinical review. Analysis of whether contrast material would have been administered to the appropriate patients (ie, those with disease of the cerebellopontine angle and/or internal auditory canal) according to CISS MR imaging findings revealed a sensitivity of 100{\%} and a specificity of 98{\%} for observer 1 and a sensitivity of 94{\%} and a specificity of 94{\%} for observer 2. CONCLUSION: CISS-3DFT MR imaging, in this patient population, provided high sensitivity and specificity in detecting lesions of the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal; however, further experience is required before a definitive statement regarding the suitability of this technique as a screening procedure can be made. When contrast material cannot be administered, CISS MR imaging may be considered an adequate examination for the evaluation of possible acoustic schwannoma},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To our knowledge, this is the first long-term follow-up study of high-dose single-session irradiation to the human brain and provides new data concerning late tissue reactions after irradiation to small target volumes. The long-term lesional brain changes in 14 patients subjected to bilateral gamma knife capsulotomy for otherwise intractable anxiety disorders were retrospectively analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: The prototype gamma unit was used for the radiosurgical procedure, and the collimators provided rectangular cross-sectional fields with an anteroposterior diameter of 3 mm and a transverse diameter of 5 or 11 mm. Maximum target doses were 120 to 180 Gy. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed 15 to 18 years (mean, 17 yr) after treatment, and dose-volume histograms were calculated for the dose distributions. RESULTS: One patient had been irradiated twice on one side. In all but one of the remaining 27 targets, lesions with a volume of less than 100 mm3 were revealed by magnetic resonance imaging. The volumes of the lesions were confined within the volume corresponding to a minimum dose of approximately 110 Gy, with one exception. In one of three targets receiving a maximum dose of 120 Gy, no lesion was detected. There were no late radiation effects such as cyst formations, telangiectasias, hemorrhagic infarctions, or neoplasms. CONCLUSION: This investigation indicates that a minimum dose of 110 Gy, with the currently used 4-mm collimator, to the edge of the target volume is required to create a lesion. The results prove that gamma knife surgery can be used in functional neurosurgery for producing small permanent lesions in the normal human brain},

At baseline, participants consisted of: (1) 35 old subjects with no cognitive impairment (controls); (2) 33 participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI); and (3) 14 patients with very mild AD. 11 participants with amnestic MCI received a diagnosis of AD over the follow-up period and 9 controls declined in cognitive function. T1 weighted MRI scans were acquired using a 3D SPGR pulse sequence. At baseline, both the amnestic MCI and mild AD groups differed from the controls in hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume, but not from each other. Longitudinal analyses showed that the rate of atrophy of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus for the stable controls differed significantly from MCI participants who converted to AD and the AD groups. Furthermore, longitudinal decreases in hippocampal and entorhinal volume were related to longitudinal decline in declarative memory performance. These findings suggest that the rate of atrophy of mesial temporal lobe structures can differentiate healthy from pathological aging.},

abstract = {Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is classically associated with neurovascular compression (NVC) of the trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone (REZ), but NVC-induced structural alterations are not always apparent on conventional imaging. Previous studies report lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the affected trigeminal nerves of TN patients using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, it is not known if TN patients have trigeminal nerve abnormalities of mean, radial, or axial diffusivity (MD, RD, AD - metrics linked to neuroinflammation and edema) or brain white matter (WM) abnormalities. DTI scans in 18 right-sided TN patients and 18 healthy controls were retrospectively analyzed to extract FA, RD, AD, and MD from the trigeminal nerve REZ, and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was used to assess brain WM. In patients, the affected trigeminal nerve had lower FA, and higher RD, AD, and MD was found bilaterally compared to controls. Group TBSS (P{\textless}0.05, corrected) showed patients had lower FA and increased RD, MD, and AD in brain WM connecting areas involved in the sensory and cognitive-affective dimensions of pain, attention, and motor functions, including the corpus callosum, cingulum, posterior corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. These data indicate that TN patients have abnormal tissue microstructure in their affected trigeminal nerves, and as a possible consequence, WM microstructural alterations in the brain. These findings suggest that trigeminal nerve structural abnormalities occur in TN, even if not apparent on gross imaging. Furthermore, MD and RD findings suggest that neuroinflammation and edema may contribute to TN pathophysiology.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional MRI provides a viable tool for assessing brain dysfunctions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without using explicit tasks. Altered resting brain functional connectivity (FC) in ALS has been reported in several studies but with large discrepancies in terms of the alteration directions. The purpose of this study was to provide new evidence for the resting FC disruptions in ALS. We focused on FC in the motor network as motor dysfunctions are a hallmark of ALS pathology. To test the hypothesis that ALS is associated with intermotor network FC changes, we compared FC of the key nodes of motor network between 12 ALS patients and 12 matched controls, and found both decreased and increased within-motor network FC in ALS patients. Increased FC between the bilateral superior parietal lobule and the right anterior inferior cerebellum was found to be correlated with disease severity, with higher FC related to more severe disease. The decreased motor network FC may be a result of motor function degradation in ALS, whereas the increased FC and its correlation to disease severity might suggest a brain mechanism to compensate the loss of the normal motor functionality in ALS. Our results also showed that the within-motor cortex FC except the within premotor area FC did not change in these early disease stage patients.},

abstract = {Myelin, the insulating layers of membrane wrapped around axons by oligodendrocytes, is essential for normal impulse conduction. It forms during late stages of fetal development but continues into early adult life. Myelination correlates with cognitive development and can be regulated by impulse activity through unknown molecular mechanisms. Astrocytes do not form myelin, but these nonneuronal cells can promote myelination in ways that are not understood. Here, we identify a link between myelination, astrocytes, and electrical impulse activity in axons that is mediated by the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These findings show that LIF is released by astrocytes in response to ATP liberated from axons firing action potentials, and LIF promotes myelination by mature oligodendrocytes. This activity-dependent mechanism promoting myelination could regulate myelination according to functional activity or environmental experience and may offer new approaches to treating demyelinating diseases.},

abstract = {In human conditions, chronic pain is associated with widespread anatomical changes in the brain. Nevertheless, little is known about the time course of these changes or the relationship of anatomical changes to perception and behaviour. In the present study, we use a rat model of neuropathic pain (spared nerve injury, SNI) and 7 T MRI to determine the longitudinal supraspinal changes associated with pain-like and anxiety-like behaviours. SNI rats and sham controls were scanned at seven time points, 1 week before surgery, 2 weeks after, and then once a month for 5 months. At each time point we performed behavioural tests, including thermal and mechanical sensitivity, and tests of locomotion and exploratory behaviour (open field and elevated plus maze). We found that SNI rats had early and sustained thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, and developed anxiety-like behaviours several months after injury. Compared to sham controls, SNI rats had decreased frontal cortex volumes several months after surgery, coincident with the onset of anxiety-like behaviours. There was also decreased volume in retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices. We also explored areas that correlated with mechanical hyperalgesia and found that increased hyperalgesia was associated with decreased volumes in bilateral S1 hindlimb area, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, areas 32 and 24), and insula. Overall, our results suggest that long-term neuropathic pain has widespread effects on brain anatomy related to the duration and magnitude of the pain},

abstract = {Diffusion imaging tractography is a valuable tool for neuroscience researchers because it allows the generation of individualized virtual dissections of major white matter tracts in the human brain. It facilitates between-subject statistical analyses tailored to the specific anatomy of each participant. There is prominent variation in diffusion imaging metrics (e.g., fractional anisotropy, FA) . within tracts, but most tractography studies use a "tract-averaged" approach to analysis by averaging the scalar values from the many streamline vertices in a tract dissection into a single point-spread estimate for each tract. Here we describe a complete workflow needed to conduct an . along-tract analysis of white matter streamline tract groups. This consists of 1) A flexible MATLAB toolkit for generating along-tract data based on B-spline resampling and compilation of scalar data at different collections of vertices along the curving tract spines, and 2) Statistical analysis and rich data visualization by leveraging tools available through the R platform for statistical computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such an along-tract approach over the tract-averaged approach in an example analysis of 10 major white matter tracts in a single subject. We also show that these techniques easily extend to between-group analyses typically used in neuroscience applications, by conducting an along-tract analysis of differences in FA between 9 individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) and 11 typically-developing controls. This analysis reveals localized differences between FASD and control groups that were not apparent using a tract-averaged method. Finally, to validate our approach and highlight the strength of this extensible software framework, we implement 2 other methods from the literature and leverage the existing workflow tools to conduct a comparison study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the CNS that is characterised by widespread lesions in the brain and spinal cord. MS results in motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, all of which can occur independently of one another. The common cognitive symptoms include deficits in complex attention, efficiency of information processing, executive functioning, processing speed, and long-term memory. These deficits detrimentally affect many aspects of daily life, such as the ability to run a household, participate fully in society, and maintain employment-factors that can all affect the overall quality of life of the patient. The increased use of neuroimaging techniques in patients with MS has advanced our understanding of structural and functional changes in the brain that are characteristic of this disease, although much remains to be learned. Moreover, examination of efforts to treat the cognitive deficits in MS is still in the early stages. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that pain can affect cognitive processes, but the cortical networks involved in pain-cognition interactions are unclear. In this study, we determined the effect of pain on the activity of cortical areas involved in cognition acting as a whole (i.e., a network). Subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while engaged in an attention-demanding cognitive task (multisource interference task) of varying difficulty and simultaneously receiving painful stimuli at varying intensities. The control (baseline) condition was simple finger tapping that had minimal cognitive demands and without pain. Functional connectivity analysis revealed a cortical network consisting of two anti-correlated parts: a task-negative part (precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, medial frontal and inferior parietal/temporal) the activity of which correlated negatively with the cognitive task and positively with the control baseline, and a task-positive part (inferior frontal, superior parietal, premotor, and anterior insula cortices) the activity of which correlated positively with the cognitive task and negatively with the baseline. Independent components analysis revealed these opposing networks were operating at a low frequency (0.03-0.08 Hz). The functional connectivity of the task-positive network was increased by cognitive demand and by pain. We suggest this attention-specific network balances the needs of general self-referential and environmental awareness versus focused attention to salient information. We postulate that pain affects cognitive ability by its reliance on this common attention-specific network. These data provide evidence that pain can modulate a network presumed to be involved in focused attention, suggesting a mechanism for the interference of pain on cognitive ability by the consumption of attentional resources.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There are no reports of patient satisfaction surveys after either a microvascular decompression (MVD) or a partial sensory rhizotomy (PSR) for trigeminal neuralgia. This study compares patient satisfaction after these two types of posterior fossa surgery for trigeminal neuralgia, because it is postulated that recurrences, complications, and previous surgical experience reduce satisfaction. METHODS: All patients who had undergone their first posterior fossa surgery at one center were sent a self-complete questionnaire by an independent physician. Among the 44 questions on four standardized questionnaires were 5 questions that related to patient satisfaction and experience of obtaining care. Patients were divided into those having their first surgical procedure (primary) and those who had had previous ablative surgery (nonprimary). RESULTS: Response rates were 90{\%} (220 of 245) of MVD and 88{\%} (53 of 60) of PSR patients. Groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, duration of symptoms, mean duration of follow-up, and recurrence rates. Overall satisfaction with their current situation was 89{\%} in MVD and 72{\%} in PSR patients. Unsatisfied with the outcome were 4{\%} of MVD and 20{\%} of PSR patients, and this is a significant difference (P {\textless} 0.01). Satisfaction with outcome was higher in those undergoing this as a primary procedure. In the primary group, satisfaction was dependent on recurrence and complication/side effects status (each P {\textless} 0.01), but this was not the case in the nonprimary group. Patients expressed a desire for earlier posterior fossa surgery in 73{\%} of MVD and 58{\%} of PSR patients, and this was highest in the primary group. The final outcome was considered to be better than expected in 80{\%} of MVD and 54{\%} of PSR patients, but 22{\%} of the PSR group (P {\textless} 0.01) thought they were worse off. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery as a primary procedure are most satisfied and PSR patients are least satisfied, partly because of a higher rate of side effects},

(ii) We agree with him when he states that findings from VBM can pertain to systematic registration errors during spatial normalization. (iii) His argument about voxelwise tests on smooth data holds in the absence of error variance, but is of no consequence when using actual data. We first review the tenets of VBM, paying particular attention to the relationship between VBM and tensor-based morphometry.

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

abstract = {The anterior nucleus of the thalamus (AN) has been suggested as a potential target for seizure modulation in animal models and patients with refractory epilepsy. We investigate whether microinjections of GABAergic agonists into the AN were protective against pilocarpine-induced generalized seizures and status epilepticus (SE). Rats were treated with bilateral AN injections of muscimol (160 or 80 nmol), bicuculline (15 nmol), or saline (controls) 20 min prior to pilocarpine administration (350 mg/kg i.p.). Electrographic recordings were used to confirm seizure activity. We found that pretreatment with AN muscimol 160 nmol increased the latency to seizures and SE by 2.5-3.0-fold. This dose however was associated with side effects, particularly hypotonia. AN bicuculline was proconvulsant, whereas no major effect was observed after muscimol 80 nmol injections. The percentage of animals that developed SE was similar across groups. Overall, microinjection of high doses of muscimol into the AN delayed the occurrence of pilocarpine-induced seizures and SE but was not able to prevent these events.},

Here the authors review evidence that 1) motor map topography reflects the capacity for skilled movement, 2) motor skill learning induces reorganization of motor maps in a manner that reflects the kinematics of acquired skilled movement, 3) map plasticity is supported by a reorganization of cortical microcircuitry involving changes in synaptic efficacy, and 4) motor map integrity and topography are influenced by various neurochemical signals that coordinate changes in cortical circuitry to encode motor experience. Finally, the role of motor map plasticity in recovery of motor function after brain damage is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an accepted surgery to treat patients with medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia. However, little is known about the mechanism of pain relief after trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery. We report the histologic findings of a human trigeminal nerve after failed radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old patient presented with a 10-year history of refractory trigeminal neuralgia. Prior surgeries included an MVD and PRGR. Gamma knife radiosurgery was performed targeting the proximal trigeminal nerve using one 4-mm isocenter (maximum dose, 85 Gy). She experienced good pain relief (no pain, reduced medications) for 16 months. She had no new trigeminal deficits after this procedure. The pain recurred, and she underwent repeat gamma knife radiosurgery targeting the distal trigeminal nerve using one 4-mm isocenter (maximum dose, 70 Gy). The pain continued to escalate until she required hospitalization for pain control and hydration. Three weeks after her second radiosurgical procedure, she underwent a repeat posterior fossa exploration. During that surgery, her trigeminal nerve was partially sectioned, and a small segment of the proximal to midcisternal nerve was sent for histological examination. There was no histologic evidence of nerve damage. CONCLUSION: This case supports the contention that trigeminal nerve injury is required to provide long lasting pain relief after trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression is an effective method of treatment in trigeminal neuralgia. It may fail if a compressing vessel is overlooked during surgery. The endoscope has an edge over the microscope in visualizing such conflicts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study of 51 patients. Preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed in all the cases. A 4 - 5 cm retroauricular skin incision was made and an about 3 cm craniectomy was performed. A 0 degrees 4 mm telescope supported by the holder was used after the dural opening. A 2 by 6 cm sheet prepared from hand gloves was used to protect the brain. A Karl Storz 30 degrees telescope was used for the visualization of the trigeminal nerve from the pons to Meckel's cave and dissection of the anterior conflict. Small pieces of dura patch were interposed between the nerve and the vessel. The microscope was not used at any stage. Post-operative infection, cerebrospinal fluid leak, cranial nerve deficit, failure of procedure in terms of pain relieves and recurrences of pain were recorded. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 55 months with an average of 36 months. RESULTS: There was no mortality or any major permanent complications. The duration of stay ranged from 3 to 10 days with an average of 3.6 days. The pain was relieved in 48 patients. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic vascular decompression is an effective and safe alternative to endoscopic assisted microvascular decompression in trigeminal neuralgia},

abstract = {Deafferentation pain following nerve injury annoys patients, and its management is a challenge in clinical practice. Although the mechanisms underlying deafferentation pain remain poorly understood, progress in the development of multidimensional neuroimaging techniques is casting some light on these issues. Deafferentation pain likely results from reorganization of the nervous system after nerve injury via processes that interact with the substrates for pain perception (the pain matrix). Therapeutic effects of motor cortex stimulation on deafferentation pain suggest that the core mechanisms underlying deafferentation pain also interact with the motor system. Therefore, simultaneous neuroimaging and brain stimulation, an emerging neuroimaging technique, was developed to investigate complicated interactions among motor, somatosensory, and pain systems. In healthy participants, parts of the pain matrix (the anterior cingulate cortex, parietal operculum, and thalamus) show activity during both somatosensory stimulation and brain stimulation to the motor cortex. This finding indicates that motor, somatosensory, and pain systems communicate among each other via the neural network. A better understanding of the plastic mechanisms influencing such cross-talk among these systems will help develop therapeutic interventions using brain stimulation and neurofeedback.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions.},

abstract = {Recent evidence for the fractionation of the default mode network (DMN) into functionally distinguishable subdivisions with unique patterns of connectivity calls for a reconceptualization of the relationship between this network and self-referential processing. Advances in resting-state functional connectivity analyses are beginning to reveal increasingly complex patterns of organization within the key nodes of the DMN - medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex - as well as between these nodes and other brain systems. Here we review recent examinations of the relationships between the DMN and various aspects of self-relevant and social-cognitive processing in light of emerging evidence for heterogeneity within this network. Drawing from a rapidly evolving social-cognitive neuroscience literature, we propose that embodied simulation and mentalizing are processes which allow us to gain insight into another's physical and mental state by providing privileged access to our own physical and mental states. Embodiment implies that the same neural systems are engaged for self- and other-understanding through a simulation mechanism, while mentalizing refers to the use of high-level conceptual information to make inferences about the mental states of self and others. These mechanisms work together to provide a coherent representation of the self and by extension, of others. Nodes of the DMN selectively interact with brain systems for embodiment and mentalizing, including the mirror neuron system, to produce appropriate mappings in the service of social-cognitive demands.},

These functional changes contribute to age-associated impairments in experimentally-induced plasticity in each of these primary hippocampal subregions. In CA1, plasticity evoked by stimulation shares common mechanisms with the synaptic modification observed following natural behavior. Aging results in deficits in both artificially- and behaviorally-induced plasticity, and this could in part reflect age-related changes in Ca2+ homeostasis. Other observations, however, suggest that increased intracellular Ca2+ levels are beneficial under some circumstances. This review focuses on age-associated changes in synaptic function, how these alterations might contribute to cognitive decline, and the extent to which altered hippocampal circuit properties are detrimental or reflect compensatory processes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Behan, Chen, Sammartino, DeSouza, Wharton-Shukster and Hodaie. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-based tractography has gained increasing popularity as a method for detailed visualization of white matter (WM) tracts. Different imaging techniques, and more novel, advanced imaging methods provide significant WM structural detail. While there has been greater focus on improving tract visualization for larger WM pathways, the relative value of each method for cranial nerve reconstruction and how this methodology can assist surgical decision-making is still understudied. Images from 10 patients with posterior fossa tumors (4 male, mean age: 63.5), affecting either the trigeminal nerve (CN V) or the facial/vestibular complex (CN VII/VIII), were employed. Three distinct reconstruction methods [two tensor-based methods: single diffusion tensor tractography (SDT) (3D Slicer), eXtended streamline tractography (XST), and one fiber orientation distribution (FOD)-based method: streamline tractography using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-derived estimates (MRtrix3)], were compared to determine which of these was best suited for use in a neurosurgical setting in terms of processing speed, anatomical accuracy, and accurate depiction of the relationship between the tumor and affected CN. Computation of the tensor map was faster when compared to the implementation of CSD to provide estimates of FOD. Both XST and CSD-based reconstruction methods tended to give more detailed representations of the projections of CN V and CN VII/VIII compared to SDT. These reconstruction methods were able to more accurately delineate the course of CN V and CN VII/VIII, differentiate CN V from the cerebellar peduncle, and delineate compression of CN VII/VIII in situations where SDT could not. However, CSD-based reconstruction methods tended to generate more invalid streamlines. XST offers the best combination of anatomical accuracy and speed of reconstruction of cranial nerves within this patient population. Given the possible anatomical limitations of single tensor models, supplementation with more advanced tensor-based reconstruction methods might be beneficial.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Microvascular decompression (MVD) offers an effective and durable treatment for patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Because the disorder has a tendency to occur in older persons, the risks of surgical treatment in the elderly have been a topic of recent interest. To date, evidence derived from several small retrospective and a single prospective case series has suggested that age does not increase the complication rate associated with surgery. Using a large national database, the authors aimed to study the impact of age on in-hospital complications following MVD for TN.

METHODS: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for the 10-year period from 1999 to 2008, the authors selected all patients who underwent MVD for TN. The primary outcome of interest was the in-hospital mortality rate. Secondary outcomes of interest were cardiac, pulmonary, thromboembolic, cerebrovascular, and wound complications as well as the duration of hospital stay, total hospital charges, and discharge location. An elderly cohort of patients was first defined as those 65 years of age and older and then redefined as those 75 years and older.

RESULTS: A total of 3273 patients who underwent MVD for TN were identified, having a median age of 57 years. Within this sample, 31.5{\%} were 65 years and older and 10.7{\%} were 75 years and older. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.68{\%} for patients 65 years or older (p = 0.0087) and 1.16{\%} for those 75 years or older (p = 0.0026). In patients younger than 65 years, the in-hospital mortality rate was 0.13{\%} (3 deaths among 2241 patients). As analyzed using the chi-square test (for both 65 and 75 years as the age cutoff) and the Pearson rank correlation coefficient, the risk of cardiac, pulmonary, thromboembolic, and cerebrovascular complications was higher in older patients (that is, those 65 and older and those 75 and older), but the risks of wound complications and CNS infection were not. The risk of any in-hospital complication occurring in a patient 65 years and older was 7.36{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001) and 10.0{\%} in those 75 years and older (p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no difference in the total hospital charges associated with age. The duration of the hospital stay was longer in older patients, and the likelihood of discharge home was lower in older patients.

CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular decompression for TN in the elderly population remains a reasonable surgical option. However, based on data from a large national database, authors of the present study suggest that complications do tend to gradually increase in tandem with an advanced age. While age does not act as a risk factor in isolation, it may serve as a convenient surrogate for complication rates. The authors hope that this information can be of use in guiding older patients through decisions for the surgical treatment of TN.},

abstract = {Context: The perception of pain due to an acute injury or in clinical pain states undergoes substantial processing at supraspinal levels. Supraspinal, brain mechanisms are increasingly recognized as playing a major role in the representation and modulation of pain experience. These neural mechanisms may then contribute to interindividual variations and disabilities associated with chronic pain conditions. Objective: To systematically review the literature regarding how activity in diverse brain regions creates and modulates the experience of acute and chronic pain states, emphasizing the contribution of various imaging techniques to emerging concepts. Data Sources: MEDLINE and PRE-MEDLINE searches were performed to identify all English-language articles that examine human brain activity during pain, using hemodynamic (PET, fMRI), neuroelectrical (EEG, MEG) and neurochemical methods (MRS, receptor binding and neurotransmitter modulation), from January 1, 1988 to March 1, 2003. Additional studies were identified through bibliographies. Study Selection: Studies were selected based on consensus across all four authors. The criteria included well-designed experimental procedures, as well as landmark studies that have significantly advanced the field. Data Synthesis: Sixty-eight hemodynamic studies of experimental pain in normal subjects, 30 in clinical pain conditions, and 30 using neuroelectrical methods met selection criteria and were used in a meta-analysis. Another 24 articles were identified where brain neurochemistry of pain was examined. Technical issues that may explain differences between studies across laboratories are expounded. The evidence for and the respective incidences of brain areas constituting the brain network for acute pain are presented. The main components of this network are: primary and secondary somatosensory, insular, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortices (S1, S2, IC, ACC, PFC) and thalamus (Th). Evidence for somatotopic organization, based on 10 studies, and psychological modulation, based on 20 studies, is discussed, as well as the temporal sequence of the afferent volley to the cortex, based on neuroelectrical studies. A meta-analysis highlights important methodological differences in identifying the brain network underlying acute pain perception. It also shows that the brain network for acute pain perception in normal subjects is at least partially distinct from that seen in chronic clinical pain conditions and that chronic pain engages brain regions critical for cognitive/emotional assessments, implying that this component of pain may be a distinctive feature between chronic and acute pain. The neurochemical studies highlight the role of opiate and catecholamine transmitters and receptors in pain states, and in the modulation of pain with environmental and genetic influences. Conclusions: The nociceptive system is now recognized as a sensory system in its own right, from primary afferents to multiple brain areas. Pain experience is strongly modulated by interactions of ascending and descending pathways. Understanding these modulatory mechanisms in health and in disease is critical for developing fully effective therapies for the treatment of clinical pain conditions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {The sense of taste exists so that organisms can detect potential nutrients and toxins. Despite the fact that this ability is of critical importance to all species there appear to be significant interspecies differences in gustatory organization. For example, monkeys and humans lack a pontine taste relay, which is a critical relay underlying taste and feeding behavior in rodents. In addition, and of particular relevance to this special issue, the primary taste cortex appears to be located further caudally in the insular cortex in humans compared to in monkeys. The primary aim of this paper is to review the evidence that supports this possibility. It is also suggested that one parsimonious explanation for this apparent interspecies differences is that if, as Craig suggests, the far anterior insular cortex is newly evolved and unique to humans, then the human taste cortex may only appear to be located further caudally because it is no longer the anterior-most section of insular cortex. In addition to discussing the location of taste representation in human insular cortex, evidence is presented to support the possibility that this region is better conceptualized as an integrated oral sensory region that plays role in feeding behavior, rather than as unimodal sensory cortex.},

In normal rats, the responses of dorsal horn WDR neurons to suprathreshold electrical stimulation of their receptive fields consisted of a short-latency (A) and a long-latency (C) response. In 77{\%} of the neurons (57/74), there was a separation between the A- and C-fiber responses. The response threshold (defined as 20{\%} increase in neuronal discharges above background activity) to mechanical stimulation applied with calibrated von Frey hairs was 13.8 g, and the discharges of these neurons to graded stimulation increased linearly. 3. In 68{\%} of WDR neurons in allodynic rats (38/56), the response to suprathreshold electrical stimuli was a single burst with no separation between A- and C-fiber responses. The magnitude and duration of the response were significantly increased compared with those recorded in normal rats. The sensitivity of these neurons to mechanical stimulation was also greatly increased, expressed by a lowered threshold (2.1 +/- 0.3 g, mean +/- SE) and a shift to the left of the nonlinear stimulus-response curve. The background activity of the neurons and the size of the receptive fields were, however, unchanged.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persistent pain is measured by means of self-report, the sole reliance on which hampers diagnosis and treatment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been identified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In four studies involving a total of 114 participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1, we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent remifentanil.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In study 1, the neurologic signature showed sensitivity and specificity of 94{\%} or more (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall. In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and nonpainful warmth with 93{\%} sensitivity and specificity (95{\%} CI, 84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain and social pain with 85{\%} sensitivity (95{\%} CI, 76 to 94) and 73{\%} specificity (95{\%} CI, 61 to 84) and with 95{\%} sensitivity and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil was administered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use fMRI to assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts clinical pain. (Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and others.).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often results in traumatic axonal injury (TAI). This can be difficult to identify using conventional imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers a method of assessing axonal damage in vivo, but has previously mainly been used to investigate groups of patients. Machine learning techniques are increasingly used to improve diagnosis based on complex imaging measures. We investigated whether machine learning applied to DTI data can be used to diagnose white matter damage after TBI and to predict neuropsychological outcome in individual patients. METHODS: We trained pattern classifiers to predict the presence of white matter damage in 25 TBI patients with microbleed evidence of TAI compared to neurologically healthy age-matched controls. We then applied these classifiers to 35 additional patients with no conventional imaging evidence of TAI. Finally, we used regression analyses to predict indices of neuropsychological outcome for information processing speed, executive function, and associative memory in a group of 70 heterogeneous patients. RESULTS: The classifiers discriminated between patients with microbleeds and age-matched controls with a high degree of accuracy, and outperformed other methods. When the trained classifiers were applied to patients without microbleeds, patients having likely TAI showed evidence of greater cognitive impairment in information processing speed and executive function. The classifiers were also able to predict the extent of impairments in information processing speed and executive function. INTERPRETATION: The work provides a proof of principle that multivariate techniques can be used with DTI to provide diagnostic information about clinically significant TAI. ANN NEUROL 2013.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are currently among the most commonly used classifiers. Despite easily achieving very good performance, one of the best selling points of these models is their modular design - one can conveniently adapt their architecture to specific needs, change connectivity patterns, attach specialised layers, experiment with a large amount of activation functions, normalisation schemes and many others. While one can find impressively wide spread of various configurations of almost every aspect of the deep nets, one element is, in authors' opinion, underrepresented - while solving classification problems, vast majority of papers and applications simply use log loss. In this paper we try to investigate how particular choices of loss functions affect deep models and their learning dynamics, as well as resulting classifiers robustness to various effects. We perform experiments on classical datasets, as well as provide some additional, theoretical insights into the problem. In particular we show that L1 and L2 losses are, quite surprisingly, justified classification objectives for deep nets, by providing probabilistic interpretation in terms of expected misclassification. We also introduce two losses which are not typically used as deep nets objectives and show that they are viable alternatives to the existing ones.},

abstract = {Supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly popular tools for fMRI decoding due to their predictive capability and their ability to capture information encoded by spatially correlated voxels. In addition, an important secondary outcome is a multivariate representation of the pattern underlying the prediction. Despite an impressive array of applications, most fMRI applications are framed as classification problems and predictions are limited to categorical class decisions. For many applications, quantitative predictions are desirable that more accurately represent variability within subject groups and that can be correlated with behavioural variables. We evaluate the predictive capability of Gaussian process (GP) models for two types of quantitative prediction (multivariate regression and probabilistic classification) using whole-brain fMRI volumes. As a proof of concept, we apply GP models to an fMRI experiment investigating subjective responses to thermal pain and show GP models predict subjective pain ratings without requiring anatomical hypotheses about functional localisation of relevant brain processes. Even in the case of pain perception, where strong hypotheses do exist, GP predictions were more accurate than any region previously demonstrated to encode pain intensity. We demonstrate two brain mapping methods suitable for GP models and we show that GP regression models outperform state of the art support vector- and relevance vector regression. For classification, GP models perform categorical prediction as accurately as a support vector machine classifier and furnish probabilistic class predictions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Mesulam1982,
abstract = {The insula of the rhesus monkey has a surface area of approximately 160 mm2 and can be divided into three architectonic sectors. The agranular sector is coextensive with prepiriform allocortex and is characterized by three agranular cellular strata, a zonal layer of myelinated fibers, and a high level of intracortical acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The dysgranular sector adjoins the agranular sector and shows first the emergence of a granular L4 and then a gradual differentiation of L2. Cortical myelin is low and mostly within deep layers; the AChE level is less than in the agranular sector. The third and granular sector covers the posterior aspect of the insula and contains granular L4 and L2, incipient sublamination of L3, increased cortical myelin with an emergent outer line of Baillarger, and a very low density of AChE. These observations indicate that AChE histochemistry can be used for the architectonic analysis of cortex. The lateral orbital cortex and the temporal pole can also be subdivided into agranular, dysgranular, and granular regions. In the insula as well as in lateral orbital and temporopolar areas, the agranular sector is directly contiguous with prepiriform cortex. When these three brain regions are considered jointly, they are seen to be organized in the form of increasingly more differentiated agranular, dysgranular, granular, and hypergranular sectors arranged concentrically around prepiriform allocortex. The term paralimbic is suggested as a generic term for all regions where such transitions occur from allocortex to granular isocortex. The insula, lateral orbital surface, and temporal pole are paralimbic areas with an olfactory allocortical focus. The parahippocampal, retrosplenial, cingulate, and subcallosal regions constitute a second group of paralimbic areas with a hippocampal-induseal focus. In the most general sense, the functional specilizations of paralimbic areas are predominantly for behaviors which require an integration between extrapersonal stimuli and the internal milieu. The human insula has a plan of organization virtually identical to that in the rhesus monkey. In the human, the insulo-orbito-temporopolar component of the paralimbic brain may become involved in conditions which range from epilepsy to psychosomatic disease.},

The nature and intensity of the signs and symptoms depend on the location of the parasite; cysticerci situated in the cysternae may cause arachnoiditis and vasculitis, but the manifestations are rarely the result of their mass effect. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with a racemose cysticercus in the left cerebellopontine angle, who presented with contralateral trigeminal neuralgia. The parasite was completely removed via a left suboccipital craniotomy. On the first postoperative day, the patient indicated that the pain had disappeared. The neuralgia was possibly caused by the distortion of the brain stem and the compression of the nerve against an arterial loop at the entry zone. This case demonstrates the advisability of obtaining imaging studies in all patients with trigeminal neuralgia before starting any treatment.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. OBJECTIVE: To compare long-term disability and health-related quality of life outcomes of individuals receiving or not receiving workers' compensation at baseline evaluation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Disability compensation has long been associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, most studies have assessed outcomes over short time periods using unvalidated measures without controlling for potential confounders. METHOD: Patients with sciatica due to a herniated lumbar disc were treated by physicians in community based orthopedic, neurosurgical, and occupational medicine practices throughout Maine. Outcomes assessed included disability compensation and work status, and health-related quality of life, controlling for initial treatment received and factors predicting initial workers' compensation status. RESULTS: Among 440 eligible patients, 172 (86{\%}) receiving workers' compensation and 222 (92{\%}) not receiving workers' compensation at baseline evaluation completed at least one follow-up between 5 and 10 years (80{\%} completed 10-year). Baseline demographics, past back history, imaging findings, symptoms, functional status, and expectations significantly differed according to the patient's baseline workers' compensation status. After 5-10 years, most patients, regardless of baseline workers' compensation status (yes or no), were not receiving disability compensation (83{\%} vs. 96{\%}, respectively) and were employed (78{\%} for both groups). However, workers' compensation patients were significantly more likely to be receiving disability compensation and had worse symptoms, functional status, and satisfaction outcomes. Outcome differences diminished in magnitude after controlling for baseline differences among patients receiving workers' compensation or not but continued to favor those not initially receiving workers' compensation. Initial treatment received, either surgical or nonsurgical, did not influence these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term employment and disability outcomes were favorable for most patients with a disc herniation, regardless of initial workers' compensation status. However, individuals initially receiving workers' compensation had worse disability and quality of life outcomes compared to individuals not receiving workers' compensation. Despite these differences, long-term work outcomes were similarly favorable},

abstract = {Drug-refractory pain is an indication for neurostimulation therapy, which can be either non-invasive [mainly transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)] or invasive which requires the intervention of a surgeon to implant electrodes and a pulse generator [peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), nerve root stimulation (NRS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and motor cortex stimulation (MCS)]. In this review, the respective mechanisms of action and efficacy of TENS, rTMS, and tDCS are discussed. The advantages of TENS include non-invasiveness and ease to use, so that the technique can be operated by the patient. TENS can be indicated as a first-line treatment in patients suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain if the painful area is limited and the sensory deficit moderate. The current best indications are chronic radiculopathies, mononeuropathies, and postherpetic pain. Test sessions allow to select suitable patients and to determine the site, frequency, and optimal intensity of stimulation. Three to four 30- to 60-minute sessions per day are usually recommended. With regard to rTMS, published randomized controlled studies in chronic neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain (fibromyalgia) reached a sufficient level of evidence to recommend this technique for the indication of implanted motor cortex stimulation for the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain or as a long-term treatment for pain syndromes, in which surgery is not indicated, such as fibromyalgia. Other indications, concerning either chronic or acute pain syndromes, such as postoperative pain, should be developed in parallel with the optimization of stimulation parameters. This also includes the availability of new coils and magnetic field waveforms and progress in neuronavigation techniques, especially by the integration of functional imaging and high-resolution EEG data},

Neuropsychological follow-up of such cases demonstrated executive function impairment. Abnormal neuroimaged activity in ACC has been found in many psychiatric conditions, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic pain, substance abuse, and schizophrenia. With healthy participants, increased neuroimaged activity in ACC has been linked with challenging executive function tasks, homeostatically incongruous physical states, and the encoding of the pleasant/averseness of stimuli. There is disagreement on the cortical substrate subsumed by the term ACC, the existence of functionally distinct ACC subregions (e.g., dorsal: cognitive vs. ventral: emotion), and the interpretation of functional neuroimaging studies. Synthesis of neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging studies suggests ACC contributes to behavior by modifying responses especially in reaction to challenging cognitive and physical states that require additional effortful cognitive control. This is accomplished by monitoring the emotional salience of stimuli, exerting control over the autonomic nervous system, and modulating cognitive activity.},

The multiple fiber architecture within a voxel is then assessed by calculating the relative probabilities of a 1 and 2 fiber model. It is demonstrated that for realistic signal to noise ratios, it is possible to accurately characterize the directions of 2 intersecting fibers using a 2 fiber model.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Adjuncts for pain management in lumbar decompressive surgery are needed to reduce narcotic consumption and promote early mobility. OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the efficacy and active components of a previously described epidural analgesic paste in controlling post-operative pain and facilitating early discharge from hospital after lumbar decompressive surgery. METHODS:: A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted. Two-hundred and one patients were randomized to one of four analgesic epidural pastes at the time of lumbar spinal surgery: combination paste (morphine + methylprednisolone), steroid paste (methylprednisolone alone), morphine paste (morphine alone), or placebo. The primary outcome measures used were analgesic consumption and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Secondary outcome measures were: modified ASIA score, SF-36, Aberdeen Pain Index (ABPI), time to ambulation and time to discharge from hospital. RESULTS:: Administration of combination and steroid paste, but not morphine paste, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean PRI and PPI components of the MPQ in the first 3 days after surgery. Likewise, post-operative in-patient narcotic analgesic consumption was reduced in the combination paste and steroid paste group, but not in the morphine paste group. No difference in time to ambulation or discharge, SF-36 scores, ABPI scores, or neurological recovery was observed. CONCLUSION:: An analgesic paste containing methylprednisolone acetate is effective at reducing post-operative pain after lumbar decompressive surgery. Mixing effective doses of morphine sulfate in the paste abrogates the expected analgesic effects of epidural morphine.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of duty-hour restrictions on outcome in neurotrauma patients. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (NIS) was analyzed for a time period with no restrictions (years 1999-2002) compared to a period with restrictions (years 2005-2008) for: 1) mortality and 2) complications. We analyzed both teaching and non-teaching hospitals to account for potential differences due to non-resident related factors. RESULTS: There were 107,006 teaching hospital and 115,604 non-teaching hospital admissions for neurotrauma. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated, in teaching hospitals, significantly higher complications in the time period with restrictions. In non-teaching hospitals, there was no difference in complications. In both teaching and non-teaching hospitals, there was no difference in mortality between the two time periods. For teaching and non-teaching hospitals, there was no difference in length of stay, but hospital charges were significantly higher in the period with restrictions. The occurrence of a complication was significantly associated with longer length of stay and higher hospital charges in both time periods in both teaching and non-teaching hospitals. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the ACGME resident duty-hour restrictions was associated with increased complications and no change in mortality for neurotrauma patients in teaching hospitals. In non-teaching hospitals, there was no change in complications and mortality. The occurrence of a complication was associated with longer length of stay and higher hospital charges in both time periods in both teaching and non-teaching hospitals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: The long-term prognosis of cerebellar astrocytomas needs to be reviewed. OBJECTIVE:: To elucidate the factors influencing the tumor recurrence or progression and to determine how long these patients require surveillance with neuroimaging. METHODS:: A retrospective review of 101 children surgically treated for a cerebellar astrocytoma and followed more than 10 years was performed. RESULTS:: Mean follow-up was 18.4 years. Total resection confirmed by postoperative imaging was performed in 51 patients (50.5{\%}) (Group A). Twenty-three patients (22.8{\%}) had surgical total resection; however, equivocal residual tumor was found on postoperative imaging (Group B). Subtotal resection leaving a portion of brainstem or cerebellar peduncle was performed in 27 patients (26.7{\%}) (Group C). Of these 50 residual tumors, 16 (32{\%}) showed spontaneous regression and 8 (16{\%}) showed arrested growth. Radiographic recurrence or progression was noted in 29 patients (28.7{\%}). Only 3 of 51 patients (5.9{\%}) of Group A with total resection had recurrence while 26 of 50 (52{\%}) residual tumors (Group B and C) progressed. The only factor affecting recurrence or progression by multivariate analysis was the extent of surgical resection. All tumor recurrence or progression except for one (96.6{\%}) occurred within 8 years from original surgery (range 2-132 months). CONCLUSIONS:: Overall prognosis of cerebellar astrocytomas is good: the 10-year survival rate was 100{\%} and recurrence or progression free rate was 71.3{\%} in our cohort. Almost half of residual tumors showed spontaneous regression or arrested growth in the long term. Eight to 10 years is considered to be a reasonable follow-up period by neuroimaging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Lumbar discectomy is the most commonly performed spine procedure. Academic spine centers with potentially differing caseloads and experience may have different outcomes. OBJECTIVE:: To determine whether the choice of center in which surgery is performed affects lumbar discectomy outcomes. METHODS:: Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) participants with a confirmed diagnosis of intervertebral disc herniation (IDH) undergoing standard first-time open discectomy were followed from baseline at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter, at 13 spine clinics in 11 US states. Patient data from this prospective study were reviewed. Enrollment began in March 2000 and ended in November 2004. RESULTS:: 792 patients underwent first-time lumbar discectomy. Significant differences were found amongst centers in patient age and race, baseline levels of disability, and treatment preferences. There were no significant differences among the centers in other patient characteristics (e.g., sex, body mass index, the prevalence of smoking, diabetes or hypertension), or disease characteristics (herniation level or type). Some short-term outcomes varied significantly among centers, including operative duration and blood loss, the incidence of durotomy, the length of hospital stay, and re-operation rate. However, there were no differences among the centers in incidence of nerve root injury, post-operative mortality, SF-36 scores of body pain or physical function, or Oswestry Disability Index at 4 years. CONCLUSION:: Although mean blood loss, risk of durotomy, length of stay, and rate of re-operation vary among academic spine centers performing lumbar discectomy, there appears to be no difference in long-term functional outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Controversy exists as to the best posterior operative procedure to treat multi-level compressive cervical spondylotic myelopathy. OBJECTIVE:: To determine clinical, radiological and patient satisfaction outcomes between these two surgical procedures. METHODS:: We performed a prospective, randomized study of Expansile Cervical Laminoplasty (ECL) vs. Cervical Laminectomy and Fusion (CLF) in patients suffering from cervical spondylotic myelopathy. End-points included the SF-36, the NDI, VAS, modified JOA score, Nurick score and radiographic measures. RESULTS:: A survey of academic North American spine surgeons (n=30) demonstrated that CLF is the most commonly used (70{\%}) posterior procedure to treat multi-level spondylotic cervical myelopathy. A total of 16 patients were randomized: CLF (n=7) / ECL (n=9). Both groups showed improvements in their Nurick grade and JOA score postoperatively, but only the improvement in the Nurick grade for the ECL group was statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05). The cervical ROM between C2 and C7 was reduced by 75{\%} in the CLF group and by only 20{\%} in the ECL group when comparing pre- and post-op range of motion. The overall increase in canal area was significantly (p{\textless}0.001) greater in the CLF, but there was a suggestion that the adjacent level was more narrowed in the CLF group in as little as 1 year post-operative. CONCLUSION:: ECL compares favorably in many respects to CLF. While patient numbers are small, there were significant improvements in pain measures in the ECL group while still maintaining range of motion. Restoration of spinal canal area was superior in the CLF group.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The management of spinal column tumors continues to be a challenge for clinicians. The mechanisms of tumor recurrence after surgical intervention as well as resistance to radiation and chemotherapy continue to be elucidated. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of metastatic spread remains an area of active investigation. There is a growing body of evidence pointing to the existence of a subset of tumor cells with high tumorigenic potential in many spine cancers that exhibit characteristics similar to stem cells. The ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple lineages are the hallmarks of stem cells, and tumor cells that exhibit these characteristics have been described as 'cancer stem cells' (CSCs). The mechanisms that allow nonmalignant stem cells to promote normal developmental programming by way of enhanced proliferation, promotion of angiogenesis, and increased motility may be used by CSCs to fuel carcinogenesis. The purpose of this review is to discuss what is known about the role of CSCs in tumors of the osseous spine. First, this manuscript will review the fundamental concepts critical to understanding the role of CSCs with respect to chemoresistance, radioresistance, and metastatic disease. This discussion will be followed by a review of what is known about the role of CSCs in the most common primary tumors of the osseous spine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on radiotherapy for trigeminal schwannomas (TS) and comparison of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) is limited. OBJECTIVE: We present a large retrospective review of our institutional experience treating TS with SRS and FSRT. We also describe a "flare" phenomenon experienced by some patients. METHODS: The records of 23 consecutive TS patients treated with radiotherapy between 1996 and 2011 were reviewed. We investigated radiographic response, tumor control, and toxicity. RESULTS: Ten patients underwent SRS and 13 underwent FSRT, with median clinical follow-up of 32 months (range 3-120 months). Tumor control at 5 and 10 years was 94{\%} overall. Symptom control at 5 years was achieved in 48{\%} of all patients, with non-significant improvement in more patients in the FSRT versus SRS group (56{\%} vs. 40{\%}, p = 0.37). Acute toxicity was higher in the FSRT group (38.5 vs. 0{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01), though lesions treated with FSRT were larger (mean 9.5cc vs. 4.8cc, p {\textless} 0.01). A symptomatic "flare" phenomenon occurred in 2 patients (8.7{\%} overall) during FSRT, involving transient cystic formation and dramatic size increase. One lesion regressed in size and one remained stable on follow-up. CONCLUSION: Tumor control rates for TS are excellent with SRS and FSRT with minimal toxicity. This represents the first documented report of a "flare" phenomenon following FSRT for TS treatment. Flare risk after FSRT in large lesions previously resected should be discussed with patients prior to treatment and prophylactic oral steroids may be considered.},

OBJECTIVE:: To clarify the safety and optimally effective conditions for performing unilateral gamma knife (GK) thalamotomy for tremors of Parkinson disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET), a systematic postirradiation 24-month follow-up study was conducted at 6 institutions. We present the results of this multicenter collaborative trial. METHODS:: In total, 72 patients (PD characterized by tremor, n = 59; ET, n = 13) were registered at 6 Japanese institutions. Following our selective thalamotomy procedure, the lateral part of the ventralis intermedius nucleus, 45{\%} of the thalamic length from the anterior tip, was selected as the GK isocenter. A single 130-Gy shot was applied using a 4-mm collimator. Evaluation included neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging and/or computerized tomography, the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), electromyography, medication change, and video observations. RESULTS:: Final clinical effects were favorable. Of 53 patients who completed 24 months of follow-up, 43 were evaluated as having excellent or good results (81.1{\%}). UPDRS scores showed tremor improvement (parts II and III). Thalamic lesion size fluctuated but converged to either an almost spherical shape (65.6{\%}), a sphere with streaking (23.4{\%}), or an extended high-signal zone (10.9{\%}). No permanent clinical complications were observed. CONCLUSION:: GK thalamotomy is an alternative treatment for intractable tremors of PD as well as for ET. Less invasive intervention may be beneficial to patients.},

The RANO group identified knowledge gaps relating to the definitions of tumor response and progression following the use of surgical or surgically based treatments. OBJECTIVE:: To outline a proposal for new response and progression criteria for the assessment of the effects of surgery and surgically delivered therapies for patients with gliomas. METHODS:: The Surgery Working Group of RANO identified surgically-related endpoint evaluation problems that were not addressed in the original Macdonald Criteria, performed an extensive literature review, and used a consensus building process to develop recommendations for how to address these issues in the setting of clinical trials. RESULTS:: Recommendations were formulated for surgically-related issues including imaging changes associated with surgical resection or surgically mediated adjuvant local therapies, the determination of progression in the setting where all enhancing tumor has been removed, and how new enhancement should be interpreted in the setting where local therapies that are known to produce non-specific enhancement have been used. Additionally, the terminology used to describe the completeness of surgical resections has been recognized to be inconsistently applied to enhancing vs. non-enhancing tumors and a new set of descriptors is proposed. CONCLUSION:: The RANO process is intended to produce endpoint criteria for clinical trials that take into account the effects of prior and ongoing therapies. The RANO criteria will continue to evolve as new therapies and technologies are introduced into clinical trial and/or practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Tight glycemic control (TGC) may improve outcomes in hyperglycemic neurosurgical patients. The adoption of TGC has been limited by lack of adequate data regarding optimal insulin delivery protocols and serum glucose concentration, and concerns regarding the risks of hypoglycemia. OBJECTIVE:: This study was designed as a meta-analysis of outcomes to compare IIT (Intensive Insulin Therapy) and TGC with CIT (Conventional Insulin Therapy) and CGC (Conventional Glucose Control). The secondary objective was to determine retrospectively whether a particular glucose range correlates with better outcomes. METHODS:: Using electronic databases, we retrieved all English language studies published between January 1997 and December 2010 reporting outcomes in neurological and neurosurgical patients as a function of glucose levels and insulin protocols. We conducted a meta-analysis around four outcome measures: infection, neurological outcome, hypoglycemia, and mortality. Effect sizes in each study were individually correlated with target IIT glucose levels. Individual studies were assessed for quality using the Jadad scale. RESULTS:: Nine studies reporting on 1459 patients met the inclusion criteria. Five were restricted to neurosurgical patients. Four included neurological patients. In comparison to CGC, TGC lowered infection rates (OR: 0.59, 95{\%} CI: 0.47-0.76, P{\textless}0.00001) and yielded better neurological outcomes (OR: 1.72, 95{\%}CI:1.36-2.16, P{\textless}0.00001). Beneficial effects increased as glucose limits tightened and study quality improved (R2 {\textgreater} 0.9 for both). TGC resulted in a higher rate of hypoglycemic events (OR: 8.04, 95{\%}CI:4.85-13.31, P{\textless}0.00001). Mortality was not affected. CONCLUSION:: TGC reduced infection risk and improved neurological outcome despite increased rates of hypoglycemic events. An optimal target for serum glucose concentrations could not be determined.},

OBJECTIVE:: To assess the prognostic value of MEI on mortality after TBI in an individual patient data meta-analysis of 3 observational TBI studies (International Mission on Prognosis and Clinical Trial Design in TBI [IMPACT]), a randomized controlled trial (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury [CRASH]), and a trauma registry (Trauma Audit and Research Network [TARN]). METHODS:: MEI (extracranial injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 3 or requiring hospital admission) was related to mortality with logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, Glasgow Coma Scale motor score, and pupil reactivity and stratified by TBI severity. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS:: We included 39 274 patients. Mortality was 25{\%}, and 32{\%} had MEI. MEI was a strong predictor for mortality in TARN, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.81 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 2.44-3.23) in mild, 2.18 (95{\%} CI, 1.80-2.65) in moderate, and 2.14 (95{\%} CI, 1.95-2.35) in severe TBI patients. The prognostic effect was smaller in IMPACT and CRASH, with pooled adjusted odds ratios of 2.14 (95{\%} CI, 0.93-4.91) in mild, 1.46 (95{\%} CI, 1.14-1.85) in moderate, and 1.18 (95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.55) in severe TBI. When patients who died within 6 hours after injury were excluded from TARN, the effect of MEI was comparable with IMPACT and CRASH. CONCLUSION:: MEI is an important prognostic factor for mortality in TBI patients. However, the effect varies by population, which explains the controversy in the literature. The strength of the effect is smaller in patients with more severe brain injury and depends on time of inclusion in a study.},

This contemporary framework of the naturally-arising immune system-tumor interaction is thought to comprise 3 phases: elimination, wherein immunity subserves an extrinsic tumor suppressor function and destroys nascent tumor cells; equilibrium, wherein tumor cells are constrained in a period of latency under immune control; and escape, wherein tumor cells outpace immunity and progress clinically. In this review, we will address in detail the relevance of the cancer immunoediting concept to neurosurgeons and neuro-oncologists treating and studying malignant glioma by exploring the de novo immune response to these tumors, how these tumors may persist in vivo, the mechanisms by which these cells may escape/attenuate immunity, and, ultimately, how this concept may influence our immunotherapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid plaque characteristics considerably influence future risk of stroke. However, the severity of stenosis does not accurately reflect plaque burden in patients with expansive arterial remodeling. OBJECTIVE: To determine the therapeutic outcome of symptomatic carotid low-grade stenosis with vulnerable plaque based on MRI characterization. METHODS: We studied 25 (male, n = 23; age, 74.2 ± 5.6 years) of 29 consecutive patients with symptomatic carotid low-grade stenosis ({\textless} 50{\%}) and both high-signal plaque and expansive remodeling on T1-weighted MR images. The remaining four were excluded due to impending stroke. A single antithrombotic and statin were administered and recurrent ischemic stroke was treated with dual antithrombotics. We considered carotid endarterectomy (CEA) when recurrence was refractory to aggressive medical treatment. RESULTS: During a 31.3 ± 16.4 month follow-up, 11 of the 25 patients developed a total of 30 recurrent ischemic events (46.0{\%} per patient-year). The patients' characteristics did not significantly differ between the groups with and without recurrence (n = 11 and n = 14, respectively). Seven of 11 patients in the recurrence group treated with CEA remained free of ischemic events during a postoperative follow-up of 19.1 ± 14.6 months. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic low-grade carotid stenosis with vulnerable plaque confirmed by MRI was associated with a high rate of stroke recurrence that was refractory to aggressive medical treatment. However, CEA was safe and effective for such patients. Plaque characterization by MRI has potential for more accurate stroke risk stratification in the management of carotid low-grade stenosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: EVD catheters provide reliable and accurate means of monitoring ICP and alleviating elevated pressures via drainage of CSF. CSF infections occur in approximately 9{\%} of patients. Antibiotic impregnated (AI)-EVD catheters were developed with the goal of reducing the occurrence of EVD catheter-related CSF infections and its associated complications. OBJECTIVE: To present an international, prospective, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate infection incidence of AI versus standard EVD catheters. METHODS: Infection was defined as: 1) Proven Infection: positive CSF culture and positive gram stain or 2) Suspected Infection: (A) Positive CSF culture with no organisms identified on initial gram stain; (B) Negative CSF culture with a gram positive or negative gram stain; (C) CSF leukocytosis with a WBC/RBC CSF count {\textgreater}0.02. RESULTS: 434 patients underwent implantation of an EVD catheter. 176 patients in the AI-EVD cohort and 181 in the standard EVD catheter cohort were eligible for evaluation of infection. The two groups were similar in all clinical characteristics. Proven Infection was documented in 9 (2.5{\%}) patients [AI: 4 (2.3{\%}) vs. standard: 5 (2.8{\%}), p=1.0]. Suspected Infection was documented in 31 (17.6{\%}) patients receiving AI and 37 (20.4{\%}) patients receiving standard EVD catheters, p=0.504. Duration of time to Suspected Infection was prolonged in the AI cohort (8.8±6.1 days) compared to the standard EVD cohort (4.6±4.2 days), p=0.002. CONCLUSION: AI-EVD catheters were associated with an extremely low rate of catheter-related infections. AI catheters were not associated with risk reduction in EVD infection compared to standard catheters. Use of AI-EVD catheters is a safe option for a wide variety of patients requiring CSF drainage and monitoring, but the efficacy of AI-EVD catheters was not supported in this trial.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: In an era of indocyanine angiography, the routine use of intra-operative angiography (IOA) in the surgical treatment of aneurysms and vascular malformations is controversial. OBJECTIVE:: We retrospectively assess the safety and efficacy of IOA and determine predictors of surgical revision. METHODS:: Between 2003-2011, IOA was performed during surgical treatment of 976 aneurysms, 101 arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and 16 arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). RESULTS:: In 80 of 976 aneurysms (8.2{\%}), IOA prompted clip repositioning. The reason for readjustment was residual aneurysm in 54.7{\%}, parent vessel occlusion in 42.9{\%}, and both in 2.4{\%} of cases. In multivariate analysis, increasing aneurysm size (p{\textless}0.001), ruptured aneurysm (p{\textless}0.001), and increasing number of vessels injected (p{\textless}0.001) were strong predictors of clip readjustment. There was a strong trend for posterior circulation aneurysm location to predict clip repositioning (p=0.06). IOA revealed residual nidus/fistula requiring further intervention in 9 (8.9{\%}) of 101 AVM and 3 (18.8{\%}) of 16 AVF. Of 9 AVM requiring a surgical revision, 2 (22.2{\%}) were Spetzler-Martin Grade II, 5 (55.6{\%}) were Grade III, and 2 (22.2{\%}) were Grade IV. Mean Spetzler-Martin Grade was 3.0 in AVM requiring surgical revision versus 2.3 in those not requiring a revision (p=0.05). IOA-related complications were all transient or minor and occurred in 0.99{\%} of patients; none resulted in permanent morbidity. CONCLUSION:: IOA remains a valuable tool in the surgical treatment of brain vascular abnormalities, guiding surgical re-exploration in over 8{\%} of cases. Easy access to angiographer and routine use of IOA are important factors contributing to procedural safety and efficacy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Although in the developed world the intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor is considered "standard of care" for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), its usefulness to direct treatment decisions has never been tested rigorously. OBJECTIVE:: The primary focus is to conduct a high quality randomized, controlled trial to determine if ICP monitoring used to direct TBI treatment improves patient outcomes. By providing education, equipment, and structure, the project will enhance the research capacity of the collaborating investigators and will foster the collaborations established during earlier studies (add refs to papers from earlier studies). METHODS:: Study centers were selected that routinely treated ICP based on clinical examination and CT imaging using internal protocols. We randomize patients to either an ICP Monitor Group or an Imaging and Clinical Examination Group. Treatment decisions for the ICP Monitor Group are guided by ICP monitoring, based on established guidelines. Treatment decisions for the Imaging and Clinical Examination Group are made using a single protocol derived from those previously being used at those centers. EXPECTED OUTCOMES:: There are two study hypotheses: 1) Patients with severe TBI whose acute care treatment is managed using ICP monitors will have improved outcomes and 2) incorporating ICP monitoring into the care of patients with severe TBI will minimize complications and decrease length of ICU stay. DISCUSSION:: This clinical trial tests the effectiveness of a management protocol based on technology considered pivotal to brain trauma treatment in the developed world - the ICP monitor. A randomized controlled trial of ICP monitoring has never been performed - a critical gap in the evidence base that supports the role of ICP monitoring in TBI care. As such, the results of this RCT will have global implications regardless of the level of development of the trauma system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) is a useful technique for confirming a pituitary source of ACTH overproduction in Cushing's disease (CD). Uncertainty still remains regarding the appropriate course of therapy when an ectopic tumor is predicted by IPSS but none can be found, and in circumstances when the procedure cannot be successfully completed due to technical or anatomical limitations. OBJECTIVE: To determine an appropriate course of action following non-diagnostic IPSS. METHODS: We reviewed 288 IPSS procedures in 283 patients between 1986 and 2010 at our Center. An IPS:peripheral (IPS:P) ACTH ratio ≥2 at baseline or ≥3 after corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) was considered predictive of a pituitary source of ACTH. A procedure was considered "non-diagnostic" if 1) the procedure was successfully performed and the results predicted an ectopic source, but none could be found despite extensive imaging, or 2) the IPS could not be bilaterally cannulated because of technical difficulties or anatomic variants. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of IPSS for detecting a pituitary source in CD were 94{\%}, 50{\%}, 98{\%}, and 29{\%}, respectively. We identified 3 categories of non-diagnostic IPSS, comprising 44 of the total procedures. These patients underwent exploratory transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), and in 42 of these (95{\%}), a pituitary source was surgically proven, with a remission rate of 83{\%}. CONCLUSION: TSS should be considered in cases of ACTH-dependent Cushing's and non-centralized or technically unsuccessful IPSS without evidence of ectopic tumor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Recent reports have shown that stent-assisted coiling (SAC) is associated with lower aneurysm recanalization rates compared to conventional coiling, raising questions about the necessity of achieving high packing density (PD) in stented aneurysms. OBJECTIVE:: To assess the impact of PD on follow-up obliteration rates of stented aneurysms and attempt to determine the optimal range of PD in SAC. METHODS:: This is a retrospective analysis of a single, large, cerebrovascular referral center's experience over a 5-year period in SAC using Neuroform and Enterprise stents. The rate of complete obliteration on follow-up angiograms was compared for 3 different PD groups: High PD ({\textgreater}22{\%}), moderate PD (12-22{\%}), and low PD ({\textless}12{\%}). RESULTS:: There were 292 stent-coiled aneurysms (36 ruptured, 256 unruptured) with available angiographic follow-up. Mean PD was 15.2{\%} and complete obliteration rate was 79.5{\%} at latest follow-up. The rates of complete obliteration were significantly higher in the moderate (86.4{\%}; OR=2.58; p=.006) and high PD groups (85.3{\%}; OR= 2.35; p=.037) compared to the low PD group (71.1{\%}). However, no statistically significant difference was found between the moderate and high PD groups (OR= 0.91; p=.84). In multivariate analysis, PD was a significant predictor of complete obliteration (p=.007) along with smaller aneurysm volumes (p=.004). Ruptured (p=.002) and cavernous aneurysms (p{\textless}.001) had significantly lower obliteration rates. CONCLUSION:: High obliteration rates at follow-up were observed despite modest packing of stented aneurysms. Although PD is a definite factor in SAC, moderate and high packing of stented aneurysms seem to provide equivalent angiographic obliteration rates at follow-up.},

abstract = {The relation of the pelvis to the spine has previously been overlooked as a contributor to sagittal balance. However, it is now recognized that spinopelvic alignment is important to maintain an energy-efficient posture in normal and disease states. The pelvis is characterized by an important anatomic landmark, the pelvic incidence (PI). The PI does not change after adolescence, and it directly influences pelvic alignment, including the parameters of pelvic tilt (PT) and sacral slope (SS) (PI = PT 1 SS), overall sagittal spinal balance, and lumbar lordosis. In the setting of an elevated PI, the spineadapts with increased lumbar lordosis. To prevent or limit sagittal imbalance, the spine may also compensate with increased PT or pelvic retroversion to attempt to maintain anupright posture. Abnormal spinopelvic parameters contribute to multiple spinal conditions including isthmic spondylolysis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, deformity, and impact outcome after spinal fusion. Sagittal balance, pelvic incidence, and all spinopelvic parameters are easily and reliably measured on standing, full-spine (lateral) radiographs, and it is essential to accurately assess and measure these sagittal values to understand their potential role in the disease process, and to promote spinopelvic balance at surgery. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the implications of abnormal spinopelvic parameters and discuss surgical strategies for correction of sagittal balance. Additionally, the authors rate and critique the quality of the literature cited in a systematic review approach to give the reader an estimate of the veracity of the conclusions reached from these reports.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The structural complexity of terminal myelocystocoele (TMC) precludes a recognizable link to spinal cord development and therefore also a plausible embryogenetic theory. OBJECTIVE: To demystify TMC using clinical, imaging, surgical, electrophysiological and histopathological data, and to propose a theory of embryogenesis. METHODS: Our series consisted of 4 newborns and 6 older children. All had pre-operative MRIs and surgical repair of the myelocystocoele using electrophysiological monitoring. RESULTS: TMC can be deconstructed into "essential" and "non-essential" features. "Essential features" are present in all TMCs and constitute the "core malformation", comprising an elongated spinal cord extending extraspinally into a CSF-filled cyst that is broadly adherent to the subcutaneous fat. The functional conus resides in the proximal cyst or within the intraspinal cord, and the caudal myelocystocoele wall is non-functional fibroneural tissue. "Non-essential features" include variable measures of hydromyelia, caudal "meningocoele" and fat, present in only some patients. TMC's core structure strikingly resembles a transitory stage of late secondary neurulation in chick in which the CSF-filled bleb-like distal neural tube bulges dorsally to fuse with the surface ectoderm, before focal apoptosis detaches it from the surface and undertakes its final dissolution. We theorize TMC results from a time-specific paralysis of apoptosis just before the dehiscence of the cystic distal cord from the future skin, thereby preserving the embryonic state. CONCLUSION: Besides tethering, the myelocystocoele may show early rapid expansion causing precipitous deterioration. We recommend early repair with resection of the non-functional caudal cyst wall, reconstruction of the proximal neural placode, and duraplasty.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mannitol has traditionally been the mainstay of medical therapy for intracranial hypertension in patients with head injury. We previously demonstrated that mannitol reduces brain volume in patients with cerebral edema, although whether this occurs due to a reduction in brain water, blood volume or both remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that mannitol acts by lowering blood viscosity leading to reflex vasoconstriction and a fall in cerebral blood volume (CBV). METHODS: We usedO PET to study six patients with traumatic brain injuries requiring treatment for intracranial hypertension. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), CBV and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) were measured before and one hour after administration of 1.0 g/kg 20{\%} mannitol. RESULTS: CBV rose from 4.1 ± 0.4 to4.2 ± 0.2 ml/100g (p=0.3) while ICP fell from 21.5± 4.9 to 13.7±5.1 mm Hg (p{\textless} 0.003) after mannitol. Blood pressure,PaCO2, oxygen content, CBF and CMRO2did not change. CONCLUSION: A single bolus of 1 g/Kg of 20{\%} mannitol does not acutely lower CBV. Another mechanism, such as a reduction in brain water, may better explain mannitol's ability to lower ICP and reduce mass effect.},
